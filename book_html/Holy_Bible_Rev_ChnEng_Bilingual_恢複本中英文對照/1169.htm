<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>我知道你的行為、勞碌、忍耐，也知道你不能容忍惡人；你也曾試驗那自稱是使徒卻不是使徒的，看出他們是假的；<br>I know your works and your labor and your endurance and that you cannot bear evil men; and you have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>你也有忍耐，曾為我的名忍受一切，並不乏倦。<br>And you have endurance and have borne all things because of My name and have not grown weary. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>2:23</a></td><td class=td>我又要用死亡擊殺她的兒女，叫眾召會都知道，我是那察看人肺腑心腸的；我且要照你們的行為報應你們各人。<br>And her children I will kill with death; and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your works. </td></tr>
