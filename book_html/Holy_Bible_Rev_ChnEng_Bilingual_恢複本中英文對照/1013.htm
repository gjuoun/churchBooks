<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>16:3</a></td><td class=td>他們這樣行，是因未曾認識父，也未曾認識我。<br>And these things they will do because they have not known the Father nor Me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>16:4</a></td><td class=td>我將這些事對你們說了，是要叫你們到了時候，可以想起我對你們說過了。我起初沒有將這些事告訴你們，因為我與你們同在。<br>But these things I have spoken to you that when their hour comes you may remember them, that I told you of them. Now these things I have not said to you from the beginning, because I was with you. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>16:9</a></td><td class=td>為罪，是因他們不信入我；<br>Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>16:10</a></td><td class=td>為義，是因我往父那裏去，你們就不再看見我；<br>And concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you no longer behold Me; </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>16:13</a></td><td class=td>隻等實際的靈來了，祂要引導你們進入一切的實際；因為祂不是從自己說的，乃是把祂所聽見的都說出來，並要把要來的事宣示與你們。<br>But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>16:14</a></td><td class=td>祂要榮耀我，因為祂要從我有所領受而宣示與你們。<br>He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>16:18</a></td><td class=td>於是他們說，祂說等不多時，到底是什麼意思？我們不知道祂說什麼。<br>Therefore they said, What is this that He says, A little while? We do not know what He is talking about. </td></tr>
