Is Saul also among the prophets?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>10:16</a></td><td class=td>掃羅對他叔叔說，他明明的告訴我們驢已經找著了。至於撒母耳所說，關於國的事，掃羅卻沒有告訴叔叔。<br>And Saul said to his uncle, He told us clearly that the donkeys had been found. But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingdom that Samuel had spoken of.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>10:17</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳將百姓召集到米斯巴耶和華那裏。<br>Then Samuel gathered the people together to Jehovah at Mizpah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>10:18</a></td><td class=td>他對以色列人說，耶和華以色列的神如此說，我領你們以色列人從埃及上來，救你們脫離埃及人的手，又救你們脫離欺壓你們各國之人的手。<br>And he said to the children of Israel, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>10:19</a></td><td class=td>你們今日卻厭棄了那親自救你們脫離一切禍患和災難的神，說，不然，求你立一位王治理我們。現在你們應當按著支派、家族，都站在耶和華麵前。<br>But today you have rejected your God, who Himself saved you from all your calamities and distresses, and have said, No; but set a king over us. And now present yourselves before Jehovah according to your tribes and according to your thousands.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>10:20</a></td><td class=td>於是，撒母耳使以色列眾支派近前來掣簽，就掣出便雅憫支派來；<br>So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>10:21</a></td><td class=td>又使便雅憫支派按著家族近前來，就掣出瑪特利家族，從其中又掣出基士的兒子掃羅。眾人尋找他，卻尋不著；<br>And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near according to its families, and the family of Matri was taken. And Saul the son of Kish was taken. But when they sought him, he could not be found.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>10:22</a></td><td class=td>所以他們又問耶和華說，有另一個人要到這裏來麼？耶和華說，看哪，他藏身在物件中間。<br>Therefore they asked of Jehovah again, Is there yet  another man coming here? And Jehovah said, There  he is; he has hidden himself among the baggage.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>10:24</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳對眾民說，你們看見耶和華所揀選的人麼？眾民中沒有一個可與他相比。眾民就呼喊說，願王萬歲！:<br>And Samuel said to all the people, See him whom Jehovah has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people. And all the people shouted and said, Long live the king!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>10:25</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳將國法告訴百姓，又記在書上，放在耶和華麵前。然後撒母耳遣散眾民，各回各家去了。<br>Then Samuel told the people the practice of the kingdom, and he wrote  it in a book and laid  it before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>10:26</a></td><td class=td>掃羅也往基比亞自己的家去，有心中被神感動的一群勇士與他同去。<br>And Saul also went to his house at Gibeah, and the men of valor, whose hearts God had touched, went with him;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>10:27</a></td><td class=td>但有些匪徒說，這人怎能救我們呢？就藐視他，沒有送他禮物；掃羅卻默不作聲。<br>But some worthless men said, How can this man save us? And they despised him and brought him no present. But he kept silent.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
