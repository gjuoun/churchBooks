<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>28:1</a></td><td class=td>禍哉，以法蓮酒徒驕傲的冠冕；禍哉，被酒所勝之人，在肥美穀山頂華美光彩的將殘之花。<br>Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty, Which is at the head of the fat valley of those who are overcome by wine.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>28:2</a></td><td class=td>看哪，主有一大能大力者；祂必像一陣冰雹，像毀滅的暴風，像漲溢泛濫的大水，用手將冠冕摔落於地。<br>Indeed the Lord has someone strong and mighty; As a hailstorm and a tempest of destruction, As a storm of mighty overflowing waters, He will cast down to the earth with His hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>28:3</a></td><td class=td>以法蓮酒徒驕傲的冠冕，必被踏在腳下；<br>The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim Will be trodden under foot;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>28:4</a></td><td class=td>那在肥美穀山頂上華美光彩的將殘之花，必像夏令以前初熟的無花果；看見這果的就注意，一到手中就吞吃了。<br>And the fading flower of its glorious beauty, Which is at the head of the fat valley, Will be like the first-ripe fig before the summer, Which when someone looks upon it he sees it, And in an instant it is in his hand, and he swallows it up.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>28:5</a></td><td class=td>到那日，萬軍之耶和華必作祂餘剩之民的華冠榮冕，<br>In that day Jehovah of hosts Will become a crown of beauty and a diadem of glory to the remnant of His people,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>28:6</a></td><td class=td>也作了在位上行審判者公平的靈，並城門口打退敵陣者的力量。<br>And a spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment And strength to those who turn away the battle at the gate.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>28:7</a></td><td class=td>但這些人，也因酒搖搖晃晃，因濃酒東倒西歪：祭司和申言者因濃酒搖搖晃晃，因酒昏亂，因濃酒東倒西歪；他們見異象時搖搖晃晃，行審判時搖擺不定。<br>But these also reel with wine And stagger from liquor: The priest and the prophet stagger from liquor; They are swallowed up with wine; They stagger from liquor, They reel in their visions, They totter in their judgments.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>28:8</a></td><td class=td>因為各席上滿了嘔吐的汙穢，無一處幹淨。<br>For all the tables are full of vomit and filth; There is no place clean.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>28:9</a></td><td class=td>譏誚申言者的說，他要將知識指教誰呢？要使誰明白傳言呢？是那剛斷奶的麼？是那剛離母懷的麼？<br>Whom will he teach knowledge? And whom will he instruct with the report? Those weaned from milk? Those drawn from the breasts?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>28:10</a></td><td class=td>因為他所說的是命令加上命令，命令加上命令，一行又一行，一行又一行，這裏一點，那裏一點。<br>For his words are: Rule upon rule, rule upon rule; Line upon line, line upon line; Here a little, there a little.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>28:11</a></td><td class=td>申言者說，不然，主要藉異邦人的嘴唇，和外邦人的舌頭，對這百姓說話；<br>For with stammering lips And with a foreign tongue He will speak to this people,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>28:12</a></td><td class=td>祂曾對他們說，這就是安息，你們要使疲乏人得安息；又說，這才是舒暢；他們卻不肯聽。<br>He who said to them, This is rest; give rest to the weary; And, This is repose. But they would not hear.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>28:13</a></td><td class=td>所以耶和華向他們說的話，是命令加上命令，命令加上命令，一行又一行，一行又一行，這裏一點，那裏一點；以致他們前行仰麵跌倒，而且跌碎，並陷入網羅，被纏住。<br>Therefore Jehovah's word to them will be: Rule upon rule, rule upon rule; Line upon line, line upon line; Here a little, there a little; That they may go and stumble backward, And be broken, snared, and taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>28:14</a></td><td class=td>所以你們這些褻慢的人，就是轄管在耶路撒冷這百姓的，要聽耶和華的話：<br>Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, You scoffing men, Who rule this people Who are in Jerusalem:</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>28:15</a></td><td class=td>因為你們曾說，我們與死亡立了約，與陰間結了盟；敵軍如水漲漫經過的時候，必不臨到我們；因我們以謊言為避難所，在虛假之內藏身；<br>Because you have said, We have  made A covenant with death, And with Sheol We have made an agreement: When the overflowing scourge passes through, It will not come upon us; For we have made falsehood our refuge And have hidden ourselves in deception.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>28:16</a></td><td class=td>所以主耶和華如此說：看哪，我在錫安放一塊石頭，作為根基，是試驗過的石頭，是寶貴的房角石，作為穩固的根基；信靠的人必不著急。<br>Therefore thus says The Lord Jehovah: Indeed I lay a stone in Zion as a foundation, A tested stone, A precious cornerstone as a foundation firmly established; He who believes will not hasten away.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>28:17</a></td><td class=td>我必以公平為準繩，以公義為線鉈；冰雹必衝去謊言的避難所，大水必漫過藏身處。<br>And I will make justice the line And righteousness the plummet; And the hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, And the waters will overflow the secret place.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>28:18</a></td><td class=td>你們與死亡所立的約必然廢掉，與陰間所結的盟必立不住；敵軍如水漲漫經過的時候，你們必被他們踐踏。<br>And your covenant with death will be annulled, And your agreement with Sheol will not stand; When the overflowing scourge passes through, You will be a trampling ground  to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>28:19</a></td><td class=td>每逢他們經過必將你們擄去；因為每早晨他們必經過，白晝黑夜都必如此。明白傳言的，必受驚恐。<br>As often as it passes through, It will take hold of you. For morning by morning it will pass through, By day and by night; And it will be nothing but terror To understand the report of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>28:20</a></td><td class=td>原來床榻短，使人不能舒身；被窩窄，使人不能遮體。<br>For the bed is too short for a man to stretch on, And the sheet is too narrow for him to wrap himself in.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>28:21</a></td><td class=td>耶和華必興起，像在毗拉心山，祂必發怒，像在基遍穀，好作成祂的工，就是非常的工，成就祂的事，就是奇異的事。<br>For Jehovah will rise as on Mount Perazim, He will be agitated as in the valley of Gibeon, To do His deed, His strange deed, And to do His work, His most different work.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>28:22</a></td><td class=td>現在你們不可作褻慢人，恐怕捆你們的綁索更結實；因為我從主萬軍之耶和華那裏聽見，要堅決的在全地上施行完全的毀滅。<br>Now therefore do not be mockers, Lest your fetters become stronger; For I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of hosts Of complete and decisive destruction upon the whole  earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>28:23</a></td><td class=td>你們當側耳聽我的聲音，留心聽我的言語。<br>Hearken and hear my voice; Attend and hear my speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>28:24</a></td><td class=td>那耕地為要撒種的，豈是終日耕地呢？豈是不斷開墾耙地呢？<br>Does the plowman plow all day long to sow his seed? Does he open and harrow his ground continually?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>28:25</a></td><td class=td>他拉平了地麵，豈不就撒種小茴香，播種大茴香，按行列種小麥，在定處種大麥，在田邊種粗麥麼？<br>Does he not, once he levels the surface, Scatter dill and broadcast cummin, And put the wheat in rows and the barley in its appointed place And the rye where it belongs?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>28:26</a></td><td class=td>因為他的神教導他這樣判斷，並且這樣指教他。<br>For his God instructs him toward such discretion And teaches him so.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>28:27</a></td><td class=td>原來打小茴香不用尖利的器具，軋大茴香也不用碾輪；但用杖打小茴香，用棍打大茴香。<br>For dill is not threshed with a sharp tool, Nor is the cart wheel turned upon the cummin; But dill is beaten out with a rod, And cummin with a stick.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>28:28</a></td><td class=td>作餅的穀是用磨磨碎，並不是不停的一打再打；一旦用碾輪和馬輥過，就不用磨。<br>Bread grains are ground, Yet one does not thresh and thresh forever. And once the wheel of his cart and his horses drive over it, One does not grind it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>28:29</a></td><td class=td>這也是出於萬軍之耶和華；祂的謀略奇妙，祂的智慧廣大。<br>This also comes forth from Jehovah of hosts, He who makes His counsel extraordinary and His sound wisdom great.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
