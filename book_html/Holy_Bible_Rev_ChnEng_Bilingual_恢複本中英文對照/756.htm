<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>11:2</a></td><td class=td>當聽這約的話，並將這些話告訴猶大人和耶路撒冷的居民。<br>Listen to the words of this covenant and speak them to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>11:3</a></td><td class=td>你要對他們說，耶和華以色列的神如此說，不聽從這約之話的人，必受咒詛。<br>And you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Cursed is the man who does not listen to the words of this covenant,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>11:4</a></td><td class=td>這約是我將你們列祖從埃及地領出來，脫離鐵爐的那日所吩咐他們的，說，你們要聽從我的話，照我所吩咐的一切去行；這樣，你們就必作我的子民，我也必作你們的神；<br>Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Listen to My voice and do the things according to all which I command you; and you will be My people and I will be your God,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>11:5</a></td><td class=td>我好堅定向你們列祖所起的誓，給他們流奶與蜜之地，正如今日一樣。我就回答說，耶和華阿，阿們。<br>That I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. And I answered and said, Amen, Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>11:6</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對我說，你要在猶大城邑中，和耶路撒冷街道上，宣告這一切話，說，你們當聽從遵行這約的話。<br>And Jehovah said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear the words of this covenant and do them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>11:7</a></td><td class=td>因為我將你們列祖從埃及地領上來的那日，曾鄭重的警戒他們；直到今日，都是從早起來警戒他們，說，你們當聽從我的話。<br>For I solemnly warned your fathers in the day that I brought them up from the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising up early and warning, saying, Listen to My voice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>11:8</a></td><td class=td>他們卻不聽從，不側耳而聽，竟都按自己頑梗的惡心而行；所以我使這約中一切咒詛的話臨到他們，這約是我吩咐他們行的，他們卻不去行。<br>But they did not listen or incline their ear, but all walked in the stubbornness of their evil heart; therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, and they have not done them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>11:9</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對我說，在猶大人和耶路撒冷居民中，有同謀背叛的事。<br>And Jehovah said to me, A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>11:10</a></td><td class=td>他們轉回到他們先祖的罪孽中，不肯聽我的話，又隨從別神，事奉他們；以色列家和猶大家違背了我與他們列祖所立的約。<br>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to listen to My words, and they have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>11:11</a></td><td class=td>所以耶和華如此說，我必使災禍臨到他們，是他們不能逃脫的；他們必向我哀求，我卻不聽。<br>Therefore thus says Jehovah, I am about to bring evil upon them, from which they cannot escape; and they will cry to Me, but I will not listen to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>11:12</a></td><td class=td>那時猶大城邑的人，和耶路撒冷的居民，要去哀求他們燒香所供奉的神；隻是他們遭難的時候，這些神毫不拯救他們。<br>Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>11:13</a></td><td class=td>猶大阿，你神的數目與你城的數目相等；你為那可恥之物所立的壇，就是向巴力燒香的壇，與耶路撒冷街道的數目相等。<br>For according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah, and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to that shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>11:14</a></td><td class=td>至於你，不要為這百姓祈禱，不要為他們呼求禱告；因為他們遭難向我呼求的時候，我必不聽。<br>And as for you, do not pray for this people, nor lift up a ringing cry or a prayer for them; for I will not hear when they call to Me because of their trouble.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>11:15</a></td><td class=td>我所親愛的既與許多人行淫，聖肉也離了你，你在我殿中作什麼呢？你作惡就喜樂。<br>What has My beloved to do in My house, Since she has committed lewdness with many And the holy flesh has passed from you? When you do evil, then you  rejoice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>11:16</a></td><td class=td>耶和華曾給你起名叫青翠的橄欖樹，外形華美，又結好果子；如今祂用哄嚷之聲，點火在其上，枝子也燒毀了。<br>Jehovah called your name, A flourishing olive tree, beautiful in fruit and form; With the sound of a great tumult He has set fire to it, And its branches are broken.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>11:17</a></td><td class=td>原來栽培你的萬軍之耶和華已經說，要降禍攻擊你，是因以色列家和猶大家行惡，向巴力燒香，惹我發怒，是自作自受。<br>And Jehovah of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done for themselves, to provoke Me to anger by burning incense to Baal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>11:18</a></td><td class=td>耶和華指示我，我就知道；你又將他們所行的，給我指明。<br>And Jehovah made it known to me, so I knew; then You showed me their deeds.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>11:19</a></td><td class=td>我像柔順的羊羔被牽去宰殺，並不知道他們設計謀害我，說，我們把樹連果子都毀滅罷，將他從活人之地剪除，使他的名不再被記念。<br>And I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter, and I did not know that they devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living that his name be remembered no longer.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>11:20</a></td><td class=td>按公義判斷，察驗人肺腑心腸的萬軍之耶和華阿，願我看見你在他們身上報仇，因我將我的案件向你稟明了。<br>But, O Jehovah of hosts, who judges righteously, Who tests the inward parts and the heart, Let me see Your vengeance on them, For I have revealed my cause to  You.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>11:21</a></td><td class=td>所以耶和華論到尋索你命的亞拿突人如此說，他們說，你不要奉耶和華的名說豫言，免得你死在我們手中；<br>Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, Do not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, that you may not die by our hand;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>11:22</a></td><td class=td>所以萬軍之耶和華如此說，我必懲罰他們，他們的少年人必被刀劍殺死；他們的兒女必因饑荒死亡。<br>Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts, I am about to punish them: The young men will die by the sword; their sons and their daughters will die by famine;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>11:23</a></td><td class=td>他們必沒有餘剩的人，因為在向他們討罪之年，我必使災禍臨到亞拿突人。<br>And they will have no remnant, because I will bring evil to the men of Anathoth in the year of their visitation.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
