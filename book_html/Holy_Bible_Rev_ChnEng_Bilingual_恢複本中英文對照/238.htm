<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>沒有誰像耶和華那樣聖別，除你以外沒有別的；也沒有磐石像我們的神。<br>There is none holy like Jehovah, For there is none besides You; Nor is there a rock like our God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>你們不要再說高傲的話，也不要口出狂妄的言語；因耶和華是全知的神，人的行為被祂衡量。<br>Talk no more so very proudly; Do not let arrogance go forth from your mouth; For Jehovah is a God of knowledge, And actions are weighed by Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>勇士的弓都被折斷；跌倒的人卻以力量束腰<br>The bows of the mighty men are broken, And those who stumbled are girded with strength.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>素來飽足的，反作雇工求食；饑餓的，不再饑餓。不能生育的，生了七個兒女；多有兒女的，反倒衰微。<br>Those who were full have hired themselves out for food, And those who were hungry are not so any longer. She who was barren has borne seven, And she who had many children languishes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>耶和華使人死，也使人活；使人下陰間，也使人上來。<br>Jehovah kills and makes alive; He brings down to Sheol and brings up.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>耶和華使人貧窮，也使人富足；使人卑微，也使人高升。<br>Jehovah makes poor and makes rich; He makes low and also lifts up.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>祂從灰塵裏抬舉貧寒人，從糞堆中提拔窮乏人，使他們與尊貴人同坐，承受榮耀的座位。地的柱子屬於耶和華，祂將世界立在其上。<br>He raises the poor from the dust, From the ash heap He lifts the needy, That He may seat  them with princes And cause  them to inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, And He has set the world upon them.</td></tr>

Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; And He will give strength to His king And exalt the horn of His anointed.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>也不理會祭司從百姓所當得的分。凡有人獻祭，正煮肉的時候，祭司的仆人就來，手拿三齒的叉子，<br>Nor did they regard the priests' rightful due with the people. When any man offered a sacrifice, the priest's attendant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand while the flesh was boiling,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>將叉子插入盆裏，或鼎裏，或釜裏，或鍋裏；叉子所插上來的，祭司都取了去。凡到示羅來的以色列人，他們都是這樣對待。<br>And he would thrust  it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot; all that the fork brought up, the priest took with it. Thus they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>甚至在未燒脂油以前，祭司的仆人就來對獻祭的人說，將肉給祭司去烤罷；他不要煮過的肉，隻要生的。<br>Indeed before they burned the fat, the priest's attendant would come and say to the man sacrificing, Give some flesh to roast for the priest, for he will not accept boiled flesh from you, but only raw.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>獻祭的人若說，必須先燒脂油，然後你才可以隨意取肉；仆人就說，你現在就給，不然我便搶去。<br>And if the man said to him, Let them burn up the fat first, then take as much as your soul desires; he would say, No, but you shall give  it now; otherwise, I will take  it by force.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>如此，這兩個少年人的罪在耶和華麵前甚大，因為他們藐視耶和華的供物。<br>And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah, for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>那時，撒母耳還是童子，束著細麻布的以弗得，在耶和華麵前供職。<br>And Samuel ministered before Jehovah, as a boy wearing a linen ephod.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>他母親每年為他作一件小外袍，同著丈夫上來獻年祭的時候帶來給他。<br>And his mother would make him a little robe and bring  it up to him yearly when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>2:21</a></td><td class=td>耶和華眷顧哈拿，她就懷孕，生了三個兒子和兩個女兒。童子撒母耳在耶和華麵前漸漸長大。<br>And Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew before Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>2:22</a></td><td class=td>以利年甚老邁，聽見他兩個兒子待以色列眾人的事，又聽見他們與會幕門前服事的婦人苟合；<br>Now Eli was very old, and he heard of all that his sons did to all Israel and how they lay with the women who were engaged in service at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>2:23</a></td><td class=td>他就對他們說，你們為何行這樣的事？我從這眾百姓聽見你們所行的惡事。<br>And he said to them, Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>2:24</a></td><td class=td>我兒阿，不可這樣；我聽見耶和華百姓所傳的風聲不好。<br>No, my sons; for it is not a good report that I hear Jehovah's people spreading.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>2:25</a></td><td class=td>人若得罪人，有神為他作仲裁；人若得罪耶和華，有誰能為他作仲裁呢？然而他們還是不聽父親的話，因為耶和華想要殺他們。<br>If one man sins against another man, God will arbitrate for him; but if a man sins against Jehovah, who will arbitrate for him? But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for Jehovah was pleased to kill them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>2:26</a></td><td class=td>童子撒母耳在身量上，並在耶和華與人對他的喜愛上，都不斷增長。<br>And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor both with Jehovah and with men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>2:27</a></td><td class=td>有神人來見以利，對他說，耶和華如此說，你父家在埃及法老家作奴仆的時候，我不是明明向他們顯現麼？<br>And a man of God came to Eli and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, I revealed Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt as slaves to Pharaoh's house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>2:28</a></td><td class=td>在以色列眾支派中，我不是揀選他們作我的祭司，使他們上我的壇，又向我燒香，並且在我麵前穿著以弗得麼？我不是將以色列人所獻的火祭都賜給你父家麼？<br>And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up to My altar, to burn incense,  and to wear the ephod before Me. And I gave the house of your father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>2:29</a></td><td class=td>我所吩咐獻在我居所的祭物和供物，你們為何踐踏呢？你為何尊重你的兒子過於尊重我，將我民以色列所獻一切供物中上好的部分肥己呢？<br>Why then do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering, which I have commanded in  My habitation, and honor your sons more than Me by making yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>2:30</a></td><td class=td>因此，耶和華以色列的神宣示說，我確實說過，你家和你父家必永遠行在我麵前；但現在我耶和華宣示說，我絕不容你們這樣行。因為尊重我的，我必尊重他們；藐視我的，他們必被輕視。<br>Therefore Jehovah the God of Israel declares, I surely said that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever; but now Jehovah declares, Far be it from Me; for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who spurn Me will be lightly esteemed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>2:31</a></td><td class=td>日子要到，我必折斷你的膀臂和你父家的膀臂，使你家中沒有一個老年人。<br>The days are now coming when I will cut off your arm and the arm of the house of your father, so that there will not be an old man in your house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>2:32</a></td><td class=td>在我使以色列人享各樣好處的時候，你必看見我居所的敗落；在你家中必永遠沒有一個老年人。<br>And you shall see the distress of  My habitation in the midst of all the good that I will do to Israel, and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>2:33</a></td><td class=td>你家中未從我壇前被我剪除的人，必使你眼目失明，魂中憂傷。你家中所增加的人口都必死在人的刀下。<br>And  that man of yours whom I do not cut off from My altar  shall be  left to consume your eyes and to grieve your soul, and all the increase of your house shall die by the swords of men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>2:34</a></td><td class=td>你的兩個兒子何弗尼、非尼哈所遭遇的事，要給你作兆頭：他們二人必同日而死。<br>And this will be the sign to you, which will come upon your two sons, upon Hophni and Phinehas: In one day both of them shall die.</td></tr>
