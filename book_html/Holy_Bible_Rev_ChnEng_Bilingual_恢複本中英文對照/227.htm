<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>16:2</a></td><td class=td>有人對迦薩人說，參孫到這裏來了。他們就把他圍住，終夜在城門悄悄埋伏，說，等到天亮我們便殺他。<br>And this was told to the Gazites, saying, Samson has come here. So they surrounded him and set an ambush for him all night long in the gate of the city. And they were quiet all night long, saying among themselves, We will stay here until the light of morning; then we will slay him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>16:3</a></td><td class=td>參孫睡到半夜，起來，抓住城門的門扇和兩邊的門框，與門閂一齊拔起來，扛在肩上，扛到希伯侖前的山頂上。<br>But Samson lay only until midnight; then he rose at midnight and grasped the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts, and he plucked them up along with the bar; and he put them on his shoulders and brought them up to the top of the mountain that is in front of Hebron.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>16:4</a></td><td class=td>後來，參孫在梭烈穀愛上了一個婦人，名叫大利拉。<br>Then after this he fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>16:5</a></td><td class=td>非利士人的首領上去見那婦人，對她說，求你誆哄參孫，看看他為何有這麼大的力氣，我們用何法才能勝過他，捆綁克製他；我們就每人給你一千一百錠銀子。<br>And the lords of the Philistines came to her; and they said to her, Entice him, and find out how it is that his strength is so great, and how we can prevail against him and bind him so that we may afflict him; and we each will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>16:6</a></td><td class=td>因此大利拉對參孫說，求你告訴我，你為何有這麼大的力氣，當用何法才能捆綁克製你。<br>So Delilah said to Samson, Tell me please, How is it that your strength is so great, and how could you be bound so that you could be afflicted?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>16:7</a></td><td class=td>參孫對她說，人若用七條未幹的青繩子捆綁我，我就軟弱像別人一樣。<br>And Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven new cords that are not dried out, I will become weak and be like any other man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>16:8</a></td><td class=td>於是非利士人的首領把七條未幹的青繩子拿上來，交給婦人，她就用繩子捆綁參孫。<br>So the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven new cords that were not dried out, and she bound him with them.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>16:10</a></td><td class=td>大利拉對參孫說，你欺哄我，向我說謊；現在求你告訴我，當用何法才能捆綁你。<br>Then Delilah said to Samson, You have just mocked me and told me lies; now tell me please, How can you be bound?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>16:11</a></td><td class=td>參孫對她說，人若用沒有使用過的新繩捆綁我，我就軟弱像別人一樣。<br>And he said to her, If they bind me up with new ropes with which no work has been done, I will become weak and be like any other man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>16:12</a></td><td class=td>大利拉就用新繩捆綁他，對他說，參孫哪，非利士人拿你來了！有埋伏的人在內室等候著。參孫將臂上的繩掙斷了，如掙斷一條線一樣。<br>So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them; and she said to him, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! And there was an ambush staying in the inner chamber. But he broke them off his arms like a thread.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>16:13</a></td><td class=td>大利拉對參孫說，你到如今還是欺哄我，向我說謊；你告訴我，當用何法才能捆綁你。參孫對她說，你若將我頭上的七條發綹，與緯線同織，用橛子釘在牆上，我就軟弱像別人一樣。<br>Then Delilah said to Samson, Until now you have mocked me and told me lies; tell me how you can be bound. And he said to her, If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web  and fasten them with the pin onto the wall, I will become weak and be like any other man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>16:14</a></td><td class=td>於是大利拉趁參孫睡覺的時候，將他的七條發綹與緯線同織，用橛子釘住，對他說，參孫哪，非利士人來捉你了！參孫從睡中醒來，將機上的橛子和緯線一齊都拔出來了。<br>So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into the web; and she fastened them with the pin. Then she said to him, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! And he awoke from his sleep and plucked up the pin of the loom and the web.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>16:15</a></td><td class=td>大利拉對參孫說，你的心既不在我這裏，怎麼說你愛我呢？你這三次欺哄我，沒有告訴我，你為何有這麼大的力氣。<br>Then she said to him, How can you say, I love you, when your heart is not with me? These three times you have mocked me and have not told me how it is that your strength is so great.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>16:17</a></td><td class=td>參孫就把心中的一切都告訴了她，對她說，向來人沒有用剃刀剃我的頭，因為我從母腹裏就歸神作拿細耳人；若剃了我的頭發，我的力氣就離開我，我便軟弱像所有的人一樣。<br>And he told her all his heart and said to her, No razor has ever come upon my head, for I have been a Nazarite to God from my mother's womb. If I were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become weak and be like all men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>16:18</a></td><td class=td>大利拉見他把心中的一切都告訴了她，就打發人去召請非利士人的首領，說，他已經把心中的一切都告訴了我，請你們再上來一次。於是非利士人的首領手裏拿著銀子，上到婦人那裏。<br>And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent word and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up once more, for he has told me all his heart. And the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and they brought the silver in their hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>16:19</a></td><td class=td>大利拉使參孫枕著她的膝睡覺，叫了一個人來，把參孫頭上的七條發綹都剃除。於是大利拉起首克製他，他的力氣離開了他。<br>And she put him to sleep in her lap and called for a man; and she shaved off the seven locks of his head. And she began to afflict him, and his strength left  him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>16:20</a></td><td class=td>大利拉說，參孫哪，非利士人來捉你了！參孫從睡中醒來，心裏說，我要像前幾次出去，抖動脫身；他卻不知道耶和華已經離開他了。<br>Then she said, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! And he awoke from his sleep and said, I will go out as at other times and shake myself free. But he did not know that Jehovah had left  him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>16:21</a></td><td class=td>非利士人將他拿住，剜了他的眼睛，帶他下到迦薩，用銅煉拘索他；他就在監裏推磨。<br>And the Philistines grabbed him and gouged out his eyes. And they took him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze fetters; and he ground at the mill in the prison house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>16:22</a></td><td class=td>然而他的頭發被剃之後，又開始長起來了。<br>But the hair on his head began to grow back after it had been shaved off.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>16:23</a></td><td class=td>非利士人的首領聚集，要給他們的神大袞獻大祭，並且歡樂；他們說，我們的神將我們的仇敵參孫交在我們手中了。<br>And the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice. And they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>16:24</a></td><td class=td>眾人看見參孫，就讚美他們的神說，我們的神將毀壞我們的地，且殺害我們許多人的仇敵交在我們手中了。<br>And when the people saw him they praised their god, for they said, Our god has delivered our enemy into our hand, even him who desolated our land, who slew many of us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>16:25</a></td><td class=td>他們心裏正高興的時候，就說，叫參孫來，在我們麵前戲耍戲耍。於是將參孫從監裏叫出來，他就在眾人麵前戲耍。他們使他站在兩柱中間。<br>And when their hearts were merry, they said, Call for Samson, that he may entertain us. So they called for Samson from the prison house, and he performed before them. Then they made him stand between the pillars.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>16:26</a></td><td class=td>參孫向拉他手的少年人說，求你讓我摸著托房的柱子，我要靠一靠。<br>And Samson said to the youth who held him by his hand, Let me feel the pillars upon which the house rests, that I may rest against them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>16:27</a></td><td class=td>那時房內充滿男女，非利士人的眾首領也都在那裏；房的平頂上約有三千男女觀看參孫戲耍。<br>Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and on the roof there were about three thousand men and women, who were looking on while Samson performed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>16:28</a></td><td class=td>參孫呼求耶和華說，主耶和華阿，求你記念我。神阿，求你賜我力量，就隻這一次，使我在非利士人身上一次報那剜我雙眼的仇。<br>And Samson called on Jehovah and said, O Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray; and strengthen me, I pray, this one time only, O God, that I may be avenged of the Philistines at once for my two eyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>16:29</a></td><td class=td>參孫就抱住托房的那兩根中間的柱子，右手一根，左手一根，並且靠著柱子，<br>And Samson grasped the two middle pillars upon which the house rested and leaned against them, one with his right hand and the other with his left.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>16:30</a></td><td class=td>說，我情願與非利士人同死。他盡力屈身，房子就倒塌，壓住首領和房內的眾人。這樣，參孫死的時候所殺的人，比活著時所殺的還多。<br>And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed with all his strength, and the house fell upon the lords and all the people who were in it.
