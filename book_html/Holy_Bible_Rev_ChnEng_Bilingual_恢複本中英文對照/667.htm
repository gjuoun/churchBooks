<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>8:1</a></td><td class=td>誰如智慧人呢？誰知道事情的解釋呢？人的智慧使他的臉發光，並使他臉上的戾氣改變。<br>Who is like the wise man? And who knows the interpretation of a matter? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the sternness of his face is changed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>8:2</a></td><td class=td>我勸你遵守王的命令；因為這是你在神前起的誓。<br>I say, Keep the commandment of the king, and that, because of the oath before God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>8:3</a></td><td class=td>不要急著離開王的麵前，不要參與惡事，因為凡王所喜悅的事，他都要行。<br>Do not hurry to leave him; do not  join in an evil matter, for he will do whatever he pleases.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>8:4</a></td><td class=td>王的話本有權力，誰會問他說，你在作什麼呢？<br>For the king's word is powerful, and who will say to him, What are you doing?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>8:5</a></td><td class=td>凡遵守命令的，必不經曆禍患；智慧人的心能曉得時機和定例。<br>He who keeps the commandment will know nothing evil, and a wise man's heart will know the proper time and manner.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>8:6</a></td><td class=td>各樣事務成就都有時機和定例，縱然人的苦難重壓在他身上；<br>For there is a proper time and manner for every purpose, although the misery of man is heavy upon him;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>8:7</a></td><td class=td>他不知道將來的事，因為將來如何，誰能告訴他呢？<br>For he does not know what will be, for who can tell him how it will be?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>8:8</a></td><td class=td>無人有權力掌管氣息，將氣息留住；也無人有權力掌管死期；在爭戰時，無人能免役，邪惡也不能救自己的主人。<br>There is no man who has power over his  breath to retain his  breath, and no one has power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in the battle, nor will wickedness deliver its own master.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>8:9</a></td><td class=td>這一切我都見過，也專心查考日光之下所作的一切事；有時這人管轄那人，使他受害。<br>All this I have seen, and I applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun when a man overpowers another man to his hurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>8:10</a></td><td class=td>然後我見惡人得以埋葬，他們生前進入並離開聖處，卻在他們這樣行的城中被人忘記。這也是虛空。<br>And then I saw the wicked buried, who before had gone in and come forth from the holy place and were forgotten in the city where they had thus acted. This also is vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>8:11</a></td><td class=td>因為對惡事的判決不立刻執行，所以世人滿心作惡。<br>Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully set within them to do evil.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>8:12</a></td><td class=td>罪人雖然作惡百次，倒享長壽；然而我也知道，敬畏神的，就是在祂麵前敬畏的人，終久必得福樂。<br>Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I also know that it will be well with the God- fearing who are in fear before Him;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>8:13</a></td><td class=td>惡人卻不得福樂，也不得享長壽；他的日子好像影兒，因他在神麵前不存敬畏。<br>But it will not be well with the wicked man, nor will he prolong his days like a shadow, because he is not in fear before God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>8:14</a></td><td class=td>地上有一件虛空的事，就是義人照惡人所行的遭報，又有惡人照義人所行的遭報。我說，這也是虛空。<br>There is a vanity that is done on the earth, that there are righteous men to whom things happen according to the deeds of the wicked and there are wicked men to whom things happen according to the deeds of the righteous. I say that this also is vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>8:15</a></td><td class=td>我就稱讚快樂，原來人在日光之下，莫強如吃喝快樂；因為在日光之下神所賜他一生的日子裏，這必在他的勞碌中，時常伴隨他。<br>So I praised pleasure, because there is nothing better for man under the sun than to eat and to drink and to rejoice; for that will stay with him in his labor during the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>8:16</a></td><td class=td>我專心要認識智慧，要看地上所作一切辛勞的事。(有晝夜不睡覺不合眼的。)<br>When I set my heart to know wisdom and to see the travail that is done on the earth (even though  man's eyes do not see sleep day or night),</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>8:17</a></td><td class=td>我就看明神一切的作為，知道人查不出日光之下所作的事；因為任憑人勞碌尋索，都找不出來；智慧人雖說他必知道，也找不出來。<br>Then I saw every work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun, because however man labors to seek it out, he will not find it out; and even if the wise man says that he will come to know it, he is not able to find it out.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
