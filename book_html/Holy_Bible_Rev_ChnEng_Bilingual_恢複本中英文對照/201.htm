<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>14:1</a></td><td class=td>以下是以色列人在迦南地所得的產業，就是祭司以利亞撒和嫩的兒子約書亞，並以色列人各支派宗族的首領所分給他們的；<br>And these are what the children of Israel received as inheritances in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of Israel gave to them as inheritances,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>14:2</a></td><td class=td>乃是照耶和華藉摩西所吩咐的，把產業拈鬮分給九個半支派。<br>By the lot of their inheritance, as Jehovah commanded through Moses for the nine tribes and the half-tribe.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>14:3</a></td><td class=td>原來摩西在約但河東，已經把產業給了那兩個半支派；隻是在他們中間，沒有把產業給利未人。<br>For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe across the Jordan; but to the Levites he did not give an inheritance among them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>14:4</a></td><td class=td>因為約瑟的子孫是兩個支派，就是瑪拿西和以法蓮，所以在那地沒有把一分地業給利未人，但給他們城邑居住，並城邑的郊野，可以牧養他們的牲畜，安置他們的財物。<br>For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim; and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in with their pasture lands for their cattle and their substance.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>14:5</a></td><td class=td>耶和華怎樣吩咐摩西，以色列人就照樣行，把地分了。<br>As Jehovah had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; thus they divided the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>14:6</a></td><td class=td>那時，猶大人來到吉甲見約書亞；基尼洗人耶孚尼的兒子迦勒對約書亞說，耶和華在加低斯巴尼亞對神人摩西所說關於我和你的話，你都知道了。<br>Then the children of Judah approached Joshua in Gilgal; and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, You know the word that Jehovah spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh- barnea.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>14:7</a></td><td class=td>耶和華的仆人摩西從加低斯巴尼亞打發我窺探這地，那時我正四十歲；我按著心裏的真誠向他回報。<br>I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me out from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I returned such a word to him as was genuinely upon my heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>14:8</a></td><td class=td>然而，同我上去的眾弟兄使百姓的心融化；但我專一跟從耶和華我的神。<br>However my brothers who went up with me made the people's heart melt, but I fully followed Jehovah my God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>14:9</a></td><td class=td>當日摩西起誓說，你腳所踏之地必定歸你和你的子孫永遠為業，因為你專一跟從耶和華我的神。<br>And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land on which your foot has trodden will be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, for you have fully followed Jehovah my God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>14:10</a></td><td class=td>現在，看哪，自從耶和華對摩西說這話的時候，耶和華照祂所說的使我存活這四十五年；其間以色列人在曠野行走。看哪，現今我八十五歲了。<br>And now, look, Jehovah has kept me alive, as He said, for these forty-five years, since the time Jehovah spoke this word to Moses while Israel walked through the wilderness. And now, look, today I am eighty-five years old.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>14:11</a></td><td class=td>今天我還是強壯，像摩西打發我去的那天一樣；無論是爭戰，是出入，我的力量那時如何，現在還是如何。<br>Today I am still as strong as I was on the day Moses sent me out; as my strength was then, so my strength is now, for battle and for going out and coming in.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>14:12</a></td><td class=td>現在求你將耶和華那日所說的這山地給我；因為那日你也曾聽見那裏有亞衲人，並寬大堅固的城邑。或者耶和華與我同在，我就把他們趕出去，正如耶和華所說的。<br>Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Jehovah spoke on that day, for you heard on that day that the Anakim were there with great fortified cities. It may be that Jehovah will be with me, and I will dispossess them, as Jehovah said.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>14:13</a></td><td class=td>於是約書亞為耶孚尼的兒子迦勒祝福，將希伯侖給他為業。<br>So Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>14:14</a></td><td class=td>所以希伯侖作了基尼洗人耶孚尼的兒子迦勒的產業，直到今日，因為他專一跟從耶和華以色列的神。<br>Therefore Hebron has become the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day because he fully followed Jehovah the God of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>14:15</a></td><td class=td>希伯侖從前名叫基列亞巴。(亞巴是亞衲族中最偉大的人。)於是那地太平，沒有爭戰了。<br>And the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba. (This Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim.) And the land had rest from war.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
