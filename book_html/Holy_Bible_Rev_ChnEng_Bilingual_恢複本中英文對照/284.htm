<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>17:2</a></td><td class=td>趁他疲乏手軟，我忽然追上他，使他驚惶；跟隨他的民必都逃跑，我就單擊殺王一人，<br>And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed. And I will terrorize him, and all the people who are with him will flee; then I will strike down the king only.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>17:3</a></td><td class=td>使全民都歸順你。你所尋索的人一死，全民就如已經歸順你；全民就必平安無事。<br>And I will bring all the people back to you; the return of the whole depends on  what happens to the man whom you are seeking. All the people will be at peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>17:4</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍和以色列的眾長老都以這話為美。<br>And the word seemed right in the sight of Absalom and in the sight of all the elders of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>17:5</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍說，把亞基人戶篩也召來，我們也要聽他怎樣說。<br>Then Absalom said, Call now for Hushai the Archite also that we may hear what he also has to say.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>17:7</a></td><td class=td>戶篩對押沙龍說，亞希多弗這次所定的計謀不好。<br>And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>17:14</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍和以色列眾人說，亞基人戶篩的計謀比亞希多弗的計謀更好；這是因耶和華命定要破壞亞希多弗的良謀，為要使災禍臨到押沙龍。<br>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel; for Jehovah had ordained the defeat of the good counsel of Ahithophel to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>17:15</a></td><td class=td>戶篩對祭司撒督和亞比亞他說，亞希多弗為押沙龍和以色列的長老所定的計謀是如此如此，我所定的計謀是如此如此。<br>Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and thus did I counsel.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>17:17</a></td><td class=td>那時，約拿單和亞希瑪斯停留在隱羅結那裏，不敢進城，恐怕被人看見；有一個使女出來，將話告訴他們，他們就去告訴大衛王。<br>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying in En-rogel, and a female servant would go and tell them, and they would go and tell King David; for they could not  risk being seen coming into the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>17:18</a></td><td class=td>然而有一個少年人看見他們，就去告訴押沙龍。他們二人急忙離開，來到巴戶琳某人的家裏；那人院中有一口井，他們就下到井裏。<br>But a young man saw them, and he told Absalom. And both of them went off quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard; and they went down into it.</td></tr>

And the woman said to them, They have crossed over the brook of water. And when they searched  for them and could not find  them, they returned to Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>17:21</a></td><td class=td>他們走後，二人從井裏上來，就去告訴大衛王。他們對大衛說，亞希多弗如此如此定謀害你們，你們務要起來，快快過溪。<br>And after they departed, they came up out of the well and went and told King David. And they said to David, Rise up and cross quickly over the water, for thus has Ahithophel given counsel against you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>17:22</a></td><td class=td>於是大衛和跟隨他的眾人都起來，過約但河；到了天亮，沒有剩下一人不過約但河的。<br>So David rose up with all the people who were with him, and they crossed over the Jordan; by morning's light there was not one left who had not crossed over the Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>17:23</a></td><td class=td>亞希多弗見他的計謀不被采納施行，就備上驢，起來往本城本家去；他安頓了家，便上吊死了，葬在他父親的墳墓裏。<br>And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey and rose up and went to his house in his city; and he set his house in order and hanged himself. And he died and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>17:25</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍立亞瑪撒統領軍隊，代替約押。亞瑪撒是以色列人以特拉的兒子；以特拉曾與拿轄的女兒亞比該親近，這亞比該與約押的母親洗魯雅是姊妹。<br>And Absalom set Amasa over the army, instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in unto Abigail the daughter of Nahash, Zeruiah's sister, Joab's mother.</td></tr>
