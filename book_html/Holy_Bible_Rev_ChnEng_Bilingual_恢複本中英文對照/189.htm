And they went and entered the house of a woman who was a harlot, whose name was Rahab; and they lay down there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>有人告訴耶利哥王說，今夜有以色列人來到這裏，探查此地。<br>And the king of Jericho was told, saying, There are some men who have now come here tonight from the children of Israel to search out the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>耶利哥王打發人去見喇合說，那來到你這裏，進了你家的人，你要交出來，因為他們來，是要探查全地。<br>Then the king of Jericho sent word to Rahab, saying, Bring out the men who have come to you and who entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>女人將二人隱藏起來，回答說，是有人到我這裏來；但他們是那裏來的，我並不知道。<br>And the woman took the two men and hid them. And she said, Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>天黑要關城門的時候，他們出去了，往那裏去我卻不知道。你們快快去追趕，必能追上。<br>And when it was time to shut the gate at dark, the men went out; I do not know where the men have gone. Pursue quickly after them, for you can overtake them.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>於是女人用繩子將二人從窗戶縋下去；因她的房子是在城牆邊上，她就住在城牆上。<br>Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the wall of the city and she dwelt on the wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>她對他們說，你們且往山上去，免得追趕的人碰見你們；要在那裏隱藏三天，等追趕的人回來，然後才可以走你們的路。<br>And she said to them, Go to the mountain, so that your pursuers do not come upon you; and hide yourselves there for three days, until your pursuers return; then afterward you can go on your way.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>我們來到這地的時候，你要把這條朱紅線繩係在縋我們下去的窗戶上，並要使你的父母、兄弟、和你父的全家，都聚集在你家中。<br>Unless, when we enter the land, you tie this line of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down, and gather your father and your mother and your brothers and all your father's house to you in your house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>凡出了你家門往街上去的，流他血的罪必歸到他自己頭上，與我們無幹。凡在你家裏的，若有人下手害他，流他血的罪就歸到我們頭上。<br>And anyone who goes forth from the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be upon his own head, and we will be innocent. And whoever is with you in the house, his blood will be upon our heads if a hand should come upon him.</td></tr>
