<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>24:2</a></td><td class=td>掃羅就從全以色列中選取三千精兵，率領他們往野羊的磐石一帶去，尋索大衛和跟隨他的人。<br>And Saul took three thousand choice men from all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the Rocks of the Wild Goats.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>24:3</a></td><td class=td>到了路旁的羊圈，在那裏有洞，掃羅進去大解。大衛和跟隨他的人正坐在洞裏的深處。<br>And he came to the sheepfolds along the way, and a cave was there. And Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost part of the cave.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>24:4</a></td><td class=td>跟隨大衛的人對他說，耶和華曾對你說，我要將你的仇敵交在你手裏，你可以照你看為好的待他；如今那日子到了。大衛就起來，悄悄的割下掃羅外袍的衣邊。<br>And David's men said to him, The day is here of which Jehovah said to you, I am about to give your enemy into your hand. Do then to him according to what seems good in your sight. So David rose up and cut off a corner of Saul's cloak without being noticed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>24:5</a></td><td class=td>隨後大衛心中自責，因為割下掃羅的衣邊；<br>But afterward David's heart smote him because he had cut off a corner of Saul's  cloak.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>24:6</a></td><td class=td>他對跟隨他的人說，我的主乃是耶和華的受膏者，我在耶和華麵前萬不敢作這樣伸手害他的事，因他是耶和華的受膏者。<br>And he said to his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do such a thing to my lord, Jehovah's anointed, as stretch out my hand against him; for he is Jehovah's anointed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>24:7</a></td><td class=td>大衛用這些話攔住跟隨他的人，不容他們起來害掃羅。掃羅起來，從洞裏出去，繼續走他的路。<br>So David checked his men with these words and would not allow them to rise up against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>24:8</a></td><td class=td>隨後大衛也起來，從洞裏出去，在掃羅後麵呼叫說，我主，我王。掃羅往後觀看，大衛就屈身，臉伏於地下拜。<br>Then David rose up afterward and came out of the cave.

And though some told  me to kill you, I spared you and said, I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he is Jehovah's anointed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>24:11</a></td><td class=td>我父阿，看看你外袍的衣邊在我手中。我割下你的衣邊，沒有殺你；你由此可以知道並看明，我手中並沒有邪惡和叛逆的事。我雖沒有得罪你，你卻獵取我的命。<br>Now my father, look, indeed, look at the corner of your cloak in my hand; for in that I cut off the corner of your cloak and did not kill you, know and see that there is no harm or transgression in my hand. And though I have not sinned against you, you hunt after my life in order to take it.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>24:17</a></td><td class=td>對大衛說，你比我公義；因為你以善待我，我卻以惡待你。<br>And he said to David, You are more righteous than I; for you have repaid me with good, while I have repaid you with evil.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>24:18</a></td><td class=td>你今日已表明你是如何以善待我；因為耶和華將我交在你手裏，你卻沒有殺我。<br>And you have declared today how you did good to me, because Jehovah delivered me up into your hand, but you would not kill me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>24:19</a></td><td class=td>人若遇見仇敵，豈肯放他安好無事的去呢？願耶和華因你今日向我所行的，以善報你。<br>For if a man finds his enemy, will he send him away safely? May Jehovah therefore reward you with good for what you have done to me this day.</td></tr>
