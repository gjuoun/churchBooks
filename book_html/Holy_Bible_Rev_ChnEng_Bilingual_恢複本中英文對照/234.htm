<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>摩押女子路得對拿俄米說，請你讓我往田間去，我在誰的眼中蒙恩，就在誰的身後拾取麥穗。拿俄米說，女兒阿，你隻管去。<br>And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I find favor. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>路得就去了。她來到田間，在收割的人身後拾取麥穗，恰巧是在以利米勒家族的人波阿斯那塊田裏。<br>So she went. And she came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to glean in a portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was from Elimelech's family.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>波阿斯正從伯利恒來，對收割的人說，願耶和華與你們同在。他們回答說，願耶和華賜福與你。<br>And just then Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, Jehovah be with you. And they said to him, Jehovah bless you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>波阿斯對監管收割之人的仆人說，那是誰家的女子？<br>And Boaz said to his young man who was set over the reapers, Whose young woman is that?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>她說，請你讓我在收割的人身後，拾取打捆剩下的麥穗。她早晨就來了，直到如今，除了在屋子裏坐一會兒，一直留在這裏。<br>And she said, Let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she has come and continued since morning until now, and she has sat in the house for only a little while.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>波阿斯對路得說，女兒阿，聽我說，不要往別人田裏拾取麥穗，也不要離開這裏，要緊隨著我的使女們。<br>And Boaz said to Ruth,  Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field, and also do not pass from here but stay close to my young women.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>你要留意她們在那塊田收割，你就跟著她們去。我已經吩咐仆人不可觸犯你；你若渴了，就可以到器皿那裏喝仆人打來的水。<br>Keep your eyes on the field that they reap; follow after them.  I have charged my young men not to touch you. And when you are thirsty, you shall go to the vessels and drink of what the young men have drawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>路得就麵伏於地叩拜，對他說，我既是外邦人，怎麼在你眼中蒙恩，使你這樣顧恤我呢？<br>And she fell upon her face and bowed herself to the ground, and she said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight that you regard me, though I am a foreigner?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>波阿斯回答說，自從你丈夫死後，凡你向婆婆所行的，並你離開父母和出生地，到素不認識的民中，這一切事人全都告訴我了。<br>And Boaz answered and said to her, All that you have done for your mother- in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told me, as well as how you left your father and mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people whom you did not know before.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>願耶和華照你所行的報答你；你來投靠耶和華以色列神的翅膀下，願你滿得祂的酬報。<br>May Jehovah recompense your work, and may you have a full reward from Jehovah the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>路得說，我主阿，願我在你眼前蒙恩；我雖然不及你的一個婢女，你還安慰我，親切的與你的婢女說話。<br>And she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord; for you have comforted me and have spoken kindly to your servant girl, though I am not like even one of your servant girls.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>到了吃飯的時候，波阿斯對路得說，你到這裏來吃點餅，將餅蘸在醋裏。路得就在收割的人旁邊坐下；波阿斯把烘了的穗子遞給她。她吃飽了，還有餘剩的。<br>And Boaz said to her at mealtime, Come here and eat some food; and dip your morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and he extended some parched grain to her. And she ate and was satisfied, and she had some left.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>她起來又拾取麥穗，波阿斯吩咐仆人說，她就是在禾捆中拾取麥穗，也可以容她，不可羞辱她；<br>And when she rose up to glean, Boaz charged his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the standing grain, and do not reproach her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>並要從捆裏抽出些來，留給她拾取，不可斥責她。<br>And also pull out some from the bundles for her, and leave it for her to glean; and do not rebuke her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>這樣，路得在田間拾取麥穗，直到晚上；將所拾取的打了，約有一伊法大麥。<br>So she gleaned in the field until evening. And she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>她就把所拾取的帶進城去給婆婆看，又把她吃飽了所剩的拿出來給婆婆。<br>And she took it up and went into the city. And her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned.  Ruth also brought out and gave to her what she had left after she had been earlier satisfied.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>婆婆對她說，你今日在那裏拾取麥穗，在那裏作工呢？願那顧恤你的蒙福。路得就告訴婆婆她在誰那裏作工，說，我今日在一個名叫波阿斯的人那裏作工。<br>And her mother-in-law said to her, Where did you glean today, and where did you work? Blessed be he who paid such attention to you. And she told her mother- in-law whom she had worked with and said, The name of the man whom I worked with today is Boaz.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>2:20</a></td><td class=td>拿俄米對兒媳說，願那人蒙耶和華賜福，因為他不斷以慈愛待活人和死人。拿俄米又說，那人與我們相近，是我們的親人。<br>And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Jehovah, whose lovingkindness has not failed for the living and for the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is close to us; he is one of our kinsmen.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>2:21</a></td><td class=td>摩押女子路得說，他也對我說，你要緊隨我的仆人拾取麥穗，直等他們收完了我的莊稼。<br>And Ruth the Moabitess said, He also said to me, You shall stay close by my young men who are with me until they have completed the whole harvest that I have.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>2:22</a></td><td class=td>拿俄米對兒媳路得說，女兒阿，你跟著他的使女出去，不叫人遇見你在別人田間，這才為好。<br>And Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, so that others do not meet you in any other field.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>2:23</a></td><td class=td>於是路得緊隨波阿斯的使女拾取麥穗，直到收完了大麥和小麥；路得仍與婆婆同住。<br>So she stayed close to Boaz's young women and gleaned until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest, and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
