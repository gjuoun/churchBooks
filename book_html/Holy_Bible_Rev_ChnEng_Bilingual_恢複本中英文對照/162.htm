You are about to cross over the Jordan this day in order to enter in and dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, cities that are big and fortified up to heaven,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>9:2</a></td><td class=td>那民是亞衲人的子孫，又大又高，是你所知道的；你也曾聽見有人指著他們說，誰能在亞衲人的子孫麵前站立得住？<br>A people great and tall, the children of the Anakim, whom you know about and of whom you have heard it said, Who can stand before the children of Anak?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>9:3</a></td><td class=td>你今日當知道，耶和華你的神是烈火，在你前麵過去，要滅絕他們，將他們製伏在你麵前，好使你照耶和華所說的，趕出他們，將他們速速消滅。<br>Know therefore today that Jehovah your God is the One crossing over before you as a consuming fire; it is He who will destroy them, and it is He who will subdue them before you, so that you may dispossess them and destroy them quickly, as Jehovah has said to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>9:4</a></td><td class=td>耶和華你的神將他們從你麵前攆出以後，你心裏不可說，耶和華將我領進來得這地，是因我的義。其實，耶和華將這些國民從你麵前趕出去，是因他們的惡。<br>Do not say in your heart when Jehovah your God drives them out from before you, Because of my righteousness, Jehovah has brought me in to possess this land. Rather, it is because of the wickedness of these nations that Jehovah is about to dispossess them from before you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>9:5</a></td><td class=td>你進去得他們的地，並不是因你的義，也不是因你心裏正直，乃是因這些國民的惡，耶和華你的神才將他們從你麵前趕出去，又因耶和華要堅定祂向你列祖亞伯拉罕、以撒、雅各起誓的話。<br>It is not because of your righteousness nor because of the uprightness of your heart that you are entering in to possess their land, but Jehovah your God is about to dispossess them from before you because of the wickedness of these nations and so that Jehovah may establish the word that He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>9:7</a></td><td class=td>你當記得，不可忘記你在曠野曾惹耶和華你的神發怒；自從你出埃及地的那日，直到你們來到這地方，你們時常悖逆耶和華。<br>Remember; do not forget that you made Jehovah your God furious in the wilderness; from the day that you came forth from the land of Egypt up until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Jehovah.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>9:12</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對我說，你起來，從這裏趕快下去，因為你的百姓，就是你從埃及領出來的，已經敗壞了；他們很快就偏離了我所吩咐他們行的道路，為自己造了鑄像。<br>Then Jehovah said to me, Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people, whom you have brought out of Egypt, have spoiled themselves; they have turned aside quickly from the way that I commanded them; they have made for themselves a molten image.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>9:13</a></td><td class=td>耶和華又對我說，我看這百姓真是硬著頸項的百姓。<br>Then Jehovah spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and indeed they are a stiff-necked people.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>9:19</a></td><td class=td>我因耶和華向你們大發烈怒，要滅絕你們，就甚害怕；但那次耶和華又應允了我。<br>For I was afraid of the anger and the burning wrath with which Jehovah was angry enough against you to destroy you. But Jehovah listened to me in that instance as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>9:20</a></td><td class=td>耶和華也向亞倫甚是發怒，要滅絕他；那時我也為亞倫禱告。<br>And Jehovah was very angry with Aaron, enough to destroy him. But I prayed also for Aaron at that time.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>9:23</a></td><td class=td>耶和華打發你們離開加低斯巴尼亞，說，你們上去得我所賜給你們的地；那時你們違背了耶和華你們神的話，不信祂，不聽祂的聲音。<br>And when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you, you rebelled at the word of Jehovah your God and did not believe Him and did not listen to His voice.</td></tr>
