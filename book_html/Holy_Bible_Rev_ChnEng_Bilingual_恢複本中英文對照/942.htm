<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>13:3</a></td><td class=td>祂就用比喻對他們講許多事，說，看哪，那撒種的出去撒種。<br>And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>13:4</a></td><td class=td>撒的時候，有的落在路旁，飛鳥來吃盡了。<br>And as he sowed, some seeds fell beside the way, and the birds came and devoured them. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>13:5</a></td><td class=td>又有的落在土淺石頭地上，土既不深，立刻發苗；<br>And others fell on the rocky places, where they did not have much earth, and immediately they sprang up because they had no depth of earth. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>13:6</a></td><td class=td>等日頭一出來，就曬焦了，又因沒有根，便枯幹了。<br>But when the sun rose, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>13:7</a></td><td class=td>還有的落在荊棘裏，荊棘長起來，就把它擠住了。<br>And others fell on the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>13:9</a></td><td class=td>有耳可聽的，就應當聽。<br>He who has ears to hear, let him hear. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>13:10</a></td><td class=td>門徒進前來，對祂說，你對眾人講話，為什麼用比喻？<br>And the disciples came and said to Him, Why do You speak in parables to them? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>13:11</a></td><td class=td>祂回答說，因為諸天之國的奧秘，隻給你們知道，不給他們知道。<br>And He answered and said to them, Because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>13:12</a></td><td class=td>因為凡有的，還要給他，他就充盈有餘；凡沒有的，連他所有的，也要從他奪去。<br>For whoever has, it shall be given to him, and he will abound; but whoever does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>13:13</a></td><td class=td>所以我用比喻對他們講，因為他們看卻看不見，聽也聽不見，也不領悟。<br>For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>13:14</a></td><td class=td>在他們身上，應驗了以賽亞的申言，說，“你們聽是要聽見，卻絕不領悟；看是要看見，卻絕看不透。<br>And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, "In hearing you shall hear and by no means understand, and seeing you shall see and by no means perceive. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>13:15</a></td><td class=td>因為這百姓心蒙脂油，耳聽不靈，眼睛閉著；恐怕他們眼睛看見，耳朵聽見，心裏領悟，回轉過來，我就醫治他們。”<br>For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and they turn around, and I will heal them.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>13:16</a></td><td class=td>但你們的眼睛是有福的，因為看見了；你們的耳朵也是有福的，因為聽見了。<br>But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>13:17</a></td><td class=td>我實在告訴你們，曾經有許多申言者和義人，渴想要看你們所看的，卻沒有看見；要聽你們所聽的，卻沒有聽見。 <br>For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to perceive the things that you see, and have not perceived them, and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>13:18</a></td><td class=td>所以你們要聽這撒種者的比喻。<br>You therefore hear the parable of the one who sowed. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>13:19</a></td><td class=td>凡聽見國度之道不領悟的，那惡者就來，把撒在他心裏的奪了去；這就是那撒在路旁的。<br>When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is the one sown beside the way. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>13:20</a></td><td class=td>又有那撒在石頭地上的，就是人聽了道，立刻歡喜領受，<br>And the one sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>13:21</a></td><td class=td>隻因他裏麵沒有根，不過是暫時的；一旦為道遭遇患難或逼迫，就立刻絆跌了。<br>Yet he does not have root in himself but lasts only for a time, and when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately he is stumbled. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>13:22</a></td><td class=td>還有那撒在荊棘裏的，就是人聽了道，後來有今世的思慮，和錢財的迷惑，把道全然擠住了，道就不能結實。<br>And the one sown in the thorns, this is he who hears the word, and the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches utterly choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>13:23</a></td><td class=td>但那撒在好土裏的，就是人聽了道，也領悟了，他就結出果實，有的結了一百倍，有的六十倍，有的三十倍。<br>But the one sown on the good earth, this is he who hears the word and understands, who by all means bears fruit and produces, one a hundredfold, and one sixtyfold, and one thirtyfold. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>13:24</a></td><td class=td>耶穌在他們跟前另設一個比喻，說，諸天的國好比人撒好種在他的田裏；<br>Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>13:25</a></td><td class=td>及至人們睡覺的時候，他的仇敵來了，將稗子撒在麥子中間，就走了。<br>But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>13:26</a></td><td class=td>到長苗吐穗的時候，稗子也顯出來。<br>And when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares appeared also. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>13:27</a></td><td class=td>家主的奴仆就進前來對他說，主啊，你不是撒好種在你的田裏麼？從那裏來的稗子？<br>And the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did the tares come from? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>13:28</a></td><td class=td>他就對他們說，這是仇敵作的。奴仆就對他說，那麼你要我們去薅集它們麼？<br>And he said to them, An enemy has done this. And the slaves said to him, Do you want us then to go and collect them? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>13:29</a></td><td class=td>他就說，不，免得薅集稗子，連麥子也一齊帶根薅出來。<br>But he said, No, lest while collecting the tares, you uproot the wheat along with them. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>13:30</a></td><td class=td>讓這兩樣一齊長，直到收割。在收割的時候，我要對收割的人說，先薅集稗子，捆成捆，好把它們燒了，麥子卻要收到我的倉裏。<br>Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat gather into my barn. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>13:31</a></td><td class=td>耶穌在他們跟前另設一個比喻，說，諸天的國好像一粒芥菜種，有人拿去種在他的田裏。<br>Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>13:32</a></td><td class=td>這乃是百種裏最小的，但長起來，卻比別的菜都大，且成了樹，甚至天空的飛鳥來棲宿在它的枝上。<br>And which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>13:33</a></td><td class=td>祂對他們另講一個比喻說，諸天的國好像麵酵，有婦人拿去藏在三鬥麵裏，直到全團都發了酵。<br>Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>13:34</a></td><td class=td>耶穌用比喻對群眾講說這一切的事，若不用比喻，就不對他們說什麼。<br>All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the crowds, and apart from a parable He spoke nothing to them, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>13:35</a></td><td class=td>這是要應驗那藉著申言者所說的，說，“我要開口用比喻，把創世以來所隱藏的事說出來。”<br>So that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, "I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>13:36</a></td><td class=td>當下，耶穌離開群眾，進了屋裏，祂的門徒到祂跟前來，說，請把田間稗子的比喻，給我們講解清楚。<br>Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, Make the parable of the tares of the field clear to us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>13:37</a></td><td class=td>祂就回答說，那撒好種的就是人子，<br>And He answered and said, He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>13:38</a></td><td class=td>田地就是世界，好種就是國度之子，稗子就是惡者之子，<br>And the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>13:39</a></td><td class=td>撒稗子的仇敵就是魔鬼，收割的時候就是這世代的終結，收割的人就是天使。<br>And the enemy who sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the consummation of the age; and the reapers are angels. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=40>13:40</a></td><td class=td>所以稗子怎樣被薅集，且被火焚燒，在這世代的終結，也要如此。<br>Therefore just as the tares are collected and burned up with fire, so will it be at the consummation of the age. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=41>13:41</a></td><td class=td>人子要差遣祂的使者，從祂的國裏薅集一切絆跌人的事，和行不法的人，<br>The Son of Man will send His angels, and they will collect out of His kingdom all the stumbling blocks and those who practice lawlessness, </td></tr>
