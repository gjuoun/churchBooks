Let My people go that they may serve Me.</td></tr>

And they ate all the vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left, and nothing green remained on the trees or among the vegetation of the field throughout all the land of Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>10:16</a></td><td class=td>於是法老急忙召了摩西、亞倫來，說，我得罪了耶和華你們的神，又得罪了你們。<br>Then Pharaoh hurriedly called for Moses and Aaron and said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God and against you.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>10:20</a></td><td class=td>但耶和華使法老的心剛硬，不讓以色列人去。<br>But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>10:21</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對摩西說，你向天伸手，使埃及地黑暗；這黑暗似乎摸得著。<br>Then Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even a darkness that can be felt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>10:22</a></td><td class=td>摩西向天伸手，埃及遍地就漆黑了三天。<br>So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick darkness throughout all the land of Egypt for three days.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>10:23</a></td><td class=td>三天之久，人彼此不能看見，也沒有人起來離開本處；惟有以色列人的住處都有亮光。<br>They could not see one another, nor did anyone rise up from his place for three days, but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>10:24</a></td><td class=td>法老就召摩西來，說，你們去事奉耶和華罷；隻是你們的羊群牛群要留下，你們的婦人孩子可以和你們同去。<br>And Pharaoh called Moses and said, Go, serve Jehovah; only let your flocks and your herds be detained. Your little ones may also go with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>10:25</a></td><td class=td>摩西說，你也得使我們有祭物和燔祭牲，我們好獻祭給耶和華我們的神。<br>And Moses said, You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings so that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>10:27</a></td><td class=td>但耶和華使法老的心剛硬，不願讓他們去。<br>But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.</td></tr>
