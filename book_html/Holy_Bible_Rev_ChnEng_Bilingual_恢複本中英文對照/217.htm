<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>6:2</a></td><td class=td>米甸人的手壓製以色列人；以色列人因米甸人的緣故，就在山中為自己挖穴、挖洞、建造營寨。<br>And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of Midian the children of Israel made for themselves the dens which are in the mountains as well as the caves and the strongholds.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>6:3</a></td><td class=td>以色列人每逢撒種之後，米甸人、亞瑪力人、和東方人都上來攻打他們，<br>And whenever Israel sowed its seed, Midian rose up with Amalek and the children of the east, and went up against them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>6:4</a></td><td class=td>對著他們安營，毀壞地的出產，直到迦薩，沒有在以色列中留下食物，羊、牛、驢也沒有留下；<br>And they encamped against them and destroyed the produce of the land until you come to Gaza, and they left no sustenance in Israel, or sheep or ox or donkey.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>6:5</a></td><td class=td>因為那些人帶著牲畜和帳棚上來，像蝗蟲那樣多，人和駱駝無數，都進入境內，毀壞那地。<br>For they went up with their cattle and their tents and came in like a locust swarm in number; both they and their camels were without number. And they came into the land to destroy it.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>6:13</a></td><td class=td>基甸說，我主，請容我說，耶和華若與我們同在，我們何至遭遇這一切事呢？我們的列祖向我們敘述的，耶和華一切奇妙的作為在那裏呢？他們說，耶和華豈不是領我們從埃及上來麼？現在祂卻丟棄我們，將我們交在米甸人的手中。<br>And Gideon said to Him, Please, my lord, if Jehovah is with us, then why has all this happened to us? And where are all His wondrous deeds that our fathers recount to us, saying, Did not Jehovah bring us up out of Egypt? But now Jehovah has abandoned us and delivered us into the hand of Midian.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>6:15</a></td><td class=td>基甸說，主阿，請容我說，我憑什麼拯救以色列人呢？我的家族在瑪拿西支派中是至貧窮的，我在我的父家又是至微小的。<br>And he said to Him, Please, Lord, by what way can I save Israel? My clan here is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>6:16</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對他說，我必與你同在，你必擊打米甸人，如擊打一人一樣。<br>And Jehovah said to him, Surely I will be with you, and you will strike the Midianites as one man.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>6:19</a></td><td class=td>於是基甸去豫備了一隻山羊羔，用一伊法細麵作了無酵餅，將肉放在筐內，把湯盛在壺中，帶到橡樹下使者那裏獻上。<br>So Gideon went and prepared a kid and an ephah of flour in unleavened cakes. He put the flesh in a basket and put the broth in a pot, and he brought it out to Him under the terebinth. And he presented it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>6:20</a></td><td class=td>神的使者對基甸說，將肉和無酵餅放在這磐石上，把湯倒出來。他就這樣行了。<br>And the Angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock; and pour out the broth. And he did so.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>6:21</a></td><td class=td>耶和華的使者伸出手內的杖，杖頭挨了肉和無酵餅，就有火從磐石中上來，燒盡了肉和無酵餅。耶和華的使者就不見了。<br>And the Angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in His hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And fire came up from the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And the Angel of Jehovah went from his sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>6:22</a></td><td class=td>基甸見祂是耶和華的使者，就說，哀哉！主耶和華阿，我不好了，因為我麵對麵看見了耶和華的使者。<br>And Gideon saw that He was the Angel of Jehovah. And Gideon said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! For I have seen the Angel of Jehovah face to face.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>6:24</a></td><td class=td>於是基甸在那裏為耶和華築了一座壇，起名叫耶和華沙龍。這壇到如今還在亞比以謝族的俄弗拉。<br>Then Gideon built an altar there to Jehovah, and he called it Jehovah-shalom. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>6:25</a></td><td class=td>當那夜，耶和華對基甸說，你取你父親的牛來，就是那七歲的第二隻牛，並且拆毀你父親為巴力所築的壇，砍下壇旁的木像，<br>And that night Jehovah said to him, Take your father's bull, that is, the second bull, seven years old; and tear down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>6:26</a></td><td class=td>在這保障頂上整整齊齊的為耶和華你的神築一座壇，將第二隻牛獻為燔祭，用你所砍下的木像作柴。<br>And build an altar to Jehovah your God upon the top of this stronghold in the ordered manner.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>6:27</a></td><td class=td>基甸就從他仆人中挑了十個人，照著耶和華告訴他的行了。他因怕父家和本城的人，不敢在白晝行事，就在夜間行了。<br>So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as Jehovah had told him. But because he was too afraid of his father's house and the men of the city to do it by day, he did it at night.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>6:28</a></td><td class=td>城裏的人清早起來，見巴力的壇拆毀，壇旁的木像砍下，第二隻牛獻在新築的壇上，<br>And when the men of the city rose up early in the morning, there was the altar of Baal, broken down; and the Asherah beside it was cut down.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>6:30</a></td><td class=td>城裏的人對約阿施說，將你兒子交出來，好治死他；因為他拆毀了巴力的壇，砍下壇旁的木像。<br>Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son that he may die, for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>6:31</a></td><td class=td>約阿施對站著攻擊他的眾人說，你們是為巴力爭辯麼？你們要救他麼？誰為他爭辯，就要趁著早晨將誰處死。巴力若是神，有人拆毀他的壇，讓他為自己爭辯罷。<br>And Joash said to all who stood against him, Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him will be put to death while it is still morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself; for his altar has been broken down.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>6:32</a></td><td class=td>所以當日人稱基甸為耶路巴力，意思說，他拆毀巴力的壇，讓巴力與他爭辯。<br>Therefore on that day he named  Gideon Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, for he has broken down his altar.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>6:33</a></td><td class=td>那時，所有的米甸人、亞瑪力人、和東方人都聚集過河，在耶斯列穀安營。<br>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east gathered together, and they crossed over and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>6:34</a></td><td class=td>耶和華的靈披戴在基甸身上，他就吹角；亞比以謝族都應召跟隨他。<br>And the Spirit of Jehovah clothed Gideon; and he blew the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called up behind him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>6:35</a></td><td class=td>他打發使者到全瑪拿西，瑪拿西人也應召跟隨他。他又打發使者到亞設、西布倫、拿弗他利，那些地方的人也都上來與他們會合。<br>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they were also called up behind him.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>6:36</a></td><td class=td>基甸對神說，你若照著你所說的，要藉我的手拯救以色列，<br>And Gideon said to God, If indeed You will save Israel through my hand, as You have said,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>6:37</a></td><td class=td>我就把一團羊毛放在禾場上：若單是羊毛上有露水，而地上都是幹的，我就知道你要照著你所說的，藉我的手拯救以色列。<br>I am laying here a fleece of wool on the threshing floor: If there is dew on the fleece alone and it is dry on all the ground, I will know that You will save Israel through my hand, as You have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>6:38</a></td><td class=td>次日基甸清早起來，見果然是這樣；他將羊毛擠一擠，從羊毛中擰出滿盆的露水來。<br>And so it happened. When he rose up early the next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung dew from the fleece, a bowlful of water.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>6:39</a></td><td class=td>基甸又對神說，求你不要向我發怒，我再說這一次：讓我將羊毛再試一次。但願隻有羊毛是幹的，而地上都有露水。<br>Then Gideon said to God, May Your anger not burn against me, but allow me to speak only this one time. Allow me to make this test with the fleece only this one time. Let it be dry on the fleece only, and let there be dew on all the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=40>6:40</a></td><td class=td>這夜神也如此行，隻有羊毛是幹的，而地上都有露水。<br>And God did so that night, so that it was dry on the fleece only and there was dew on all the ground.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
