<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>53:1</a></td><td class=td>我們所傳的，有誰信呢？耶和華的膀臂向誰顯露呢？<br>Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>53:2</a></td><td class=td>祂在耶和華麵前生長如嫩芽，像根出於幹地。祂無佳形華美叫我們觀看祂，也無美貌使我們羨慕祂。<br>For He grew up like a tender plant before Him, And like a root out of dry  ground. He has no attracting form nor  majesty that we should look  upon Him, Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>53:3</a></td><td class=td>祂被藐視，被人厭棄，多受痛苦，常經憂患；祂被藐視，好像被人掩麵不看的一樣；我們也不尊重祂。<br>He was despised and forsaken of  men, A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; And like one from whom men hide their faces, He was despised; and we did not esteem Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>53:4</a></td><td class=td>祂誠然擔當了我們的憂患，背負了我們的痛苦；我們卻以為祂受責罰，被神擊打苦待了。<br>Surely He has borne our  sicknesses, And carried our sorrows; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God and afflicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>53:5</a></td><td class=td>那知祂為我們的過犯受創，為我們的罪孽壓傷；因祂受的刑罰我們得平安，因祂受的鞭傷我們得醫治。<br>But He was wounded because of our transgressions; He was crushed because of our iniquities; The chastening for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we have been healed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>53:6</a></td><td class=td>我們都如羊走迷，各人偏行己路；耶和華使我們眾人的罪孽都歸在祂身上。<br>We all like sheep have gone astray; Each of us has turned to his own way, And Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>53:7</a></td><td class=td>祂被欺壓，受苦卻不開口；祂像羊羔被牽去宰殺，又像羊在剪毛的人麵前無聲，祂也是這樣不開口。<br>He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, Yet He did not open His mouth; Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, So He did not open His mouth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>53:8</a></td><td class=td>因受欺壓和審判祂被奪去；至於祂那世代的人，誰想祂是因我百姓的過犯，受他們所當受的鞭打，從活人之地被剪除呢？<br>By oppression and by judgment He was taken away; And as for His generation, who among them had the thought That He was cut off out of the land of the living For the transgression of my peopleto whom the stroke was due?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>53:9</a></td><td class=td>祂雖然未行強暴，口中也沒有詭詐，人還使祂與惡人同埋，誰知死的時候與財主同葬。<br>And they assigned His grave with the wicked, But with a rich man in His death, Although He had done no violence, Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>53:10</a></td><td class=td>耶和華卻喜悅將祂壓傷，使祂受痛苦。祂使自己成了為著罪的祭，祂必看見後裔，並且延長年日；耶和華所喜悅的事，必在祂手中亨通。<br>But Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief. When He makes Himself an offering for sin, He will see a seed, He will extend His days, And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>53:11</a></td><td class=td>祂必看見自己勞苦的果效，便心滿意足；有許多人，因認識那義者我的仆人而成為義的；並且祂要擔當他們的罪孽。<br>He will see the fruit of the travail of His soul,  And He will be satisfied; By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant, will make the many righteous, And He will bear their iniquities.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>53:12</a></td><td class=td>所以我要使祂與至大者同分，與至強者均分擄物；因為祂將命傾倒，以至於死，且被算在罪犯之中；惟獨祂擔當多人的罪，又為罪犯代求。<br>Therefore I will divide to Him a portion with the Great, And He will divide the spoil with the Strong; Because He poured out His life unto death And was numbered with the transgressors, Yet He alone bore the sin of many And interceded for the transgressors.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
