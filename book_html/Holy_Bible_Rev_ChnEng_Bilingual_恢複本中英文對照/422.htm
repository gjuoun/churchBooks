<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>9:26</a></td><td class=td>然而，他們竟不順從，背叛了你，將你的律法丟在背後，殺害那些向他們作見證，要使他們歸向你的眾申言者，大大褻慢了你。<br>But they were disobedient and rebelled against You And cast Your law behind their back. And they slew Your prophets, Who had testified against them In order to turn them back to You; And they showed great contempt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>9:27</a></td><td class=td>所以你將他們交在敵人的手中，困迫他們；他們遭困迫的時候哀求你，你就從天上垂聽，照你的大憐恤賜給他們拯救者，救他們脫離敵人的手。<br>Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their oppressors, And they oppressed them; But when they cried out to You in the time of their oppression, You heard from heaven, And according to Your great compassions You gave them deliverers, Who delivered them from the hand of their oppressors.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>9:28</a></td><td class=td>但他們得安息之後，又在你麵前行惡；你就丟棄他們在仇敵的手中，使仇敵轄製他們。然而他們轉回哀求你，你仍從天上垂聽，屢次照你的憐恤拯救他們。<br>Then after they had rest, They again did evil before You; And You abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, And they had dominion over them.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>9:29</a></td><td class=td>你警戒他們，要使他們歸服你的律法；他們卻行事狂傲，不聽從你的誡命，幹犯你的典章，(人若行這些，必因這些活著，)扭轉肩頭，硬著頸項，不肯聽從。<br>And You testified against them in order to turn them back to Your law, But they acted arrogantly and would not listen to Your commandments; And they sinned against Your ordinances (By which, if a man does them, he will live), And they turned a stubborn shoulder And stiffened their neck and would not listen.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>9:30</a></td><td class=td>你多年寬容他們，又用你的靈藉你的眾申言者警戒他們，他們仍不聽從；所以你將他們交在各地之民的手中。<br>Yet You bore with them For many years And testified to them by Your Spirit Through Your prophets, But they would not give heed; So You delivered them Into the hand of the peoples of the lands.</td></tr>
