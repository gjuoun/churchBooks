<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>你們要對你們的弟兄說，阿米；要對你們的姊妹說，路哈瑪。<br>Say to your brothers, Ammi, And to your sisters, Ruhamah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>你們要與你們的母親大大爭辯，因為她不是我的妻子，我也不是她的丈夫；叫她除掉臉上的淫亂，和胸間的奸淫，<br>Contend with your mother; contend. For she is not my wife, And I am not her husband. And let her turn away her harlotries from her face, And her adulteries from between her breasts,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>免得我剝去她的衣服，使她赤身像才生的日子一樣，使她如曠野，如幹旱之地，以幹渴殺死她。<br>Lest I strip her naked And set her out as in the day she was born And make her a wilderness And make her a dry land And slay her with thirst.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>我必不憐恤她的兒女，因為他們是從淫亂生的兒女。<br>And on her children I will not have compassion, For they are the children of  harlotries.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>他們的母親行了淫亂，懷他們的母作了可羞恥的事，因為她說，我要隨從所愛的人，他們給我餅和水，羊毛和麻，油和酒。<br>For their mother has gone about as a harlot; She who conceived them has acted shamefully; For she has said, I will go after my lovers, Who give me my bread and my  water, My wool and my flax, My oil and my drink.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>因此，我必用荊棘堵塞她的道，築牆擋住她，使她找不著路。<br>Therefore I will now hedge up  Her way with thorns; And I will build up a wall against her, So that she will not find her paths.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>她必追隨所愛的人，卻追不上，她必尋找他們，卻尋不見；便說，我要歸回前夫，因我那時的光景比如今還好。<br>And she will pursue her lovers But will not overtake them; And she will seek them but not find them; And she will say, I will go And return to my first husband, For it was better for me then than now.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>她不知道是我給她五穀、新酒和新油；又加增她的金銀；他們卻用於巴力。<br>For she did not know That it was I who gave her The grain and the new wine and the fresh oil, And who multiplied to her silver And gold, which they  used for Baal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>因此到了收割的時候，出酒的季節，我必將我的五穀新酒收回，也必將她應當遮體的羊毛和麻奪去。<br>Therefore I will  take back My grain in its time And My new wine in its appointed season, And I will snatch away My wool and My flax, Which were to cover her  nakedness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>如今我必在她所愛的人眼前，顯露她的淫蕩，必無人能救她脫離我的手。<br>And now I will uncover her lewdness In the sight of her lovers, And no one will deliver her from My hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>我必使她一切的歡樂，她的節期、月朔、安息日、並她所定一切的會，都止息了。<br>And I will bring all her mirth to an end, Her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, And all her appointed assemblies.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>我也必使她的葡萄樹和無花果樹荒蕪，就是她說，這是我所愛的人給我為代價的；我必使這些樹變為叢林，為田野的走獸所吃。<br>And I will desolate her vine and her fig tree, Of which she said, These are my payments That my lovers have given me; And I will make them a forest, And the beasts of the field will devour them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>我必在她身上追討她素日給諸巴力燒香的罪，那時她佩帶鼻環和珠寶，隨從她所愛的人，卻忘記了我；這是耶和華說的。<br>And I will visit the days of the Baals upon her,  In which she offered incense to them And adorned herself with her nose rings and her jewels And went after her lovers And forgot Me, Declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>因此我必誘導她，領她到曠野，對她的心說話；<br>Therefore I am now luring her, And I will bring her into the wilderness And will speak to her heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>從那裏我必賜她葡萄園，又賜她亞割穀作為指望的門；她必在那裏應聲，與她幼年的日子一樣，與她從埃及地上來的日子相同。<br>And I will give her her vineyards from there And the valley of Achor as a door of hope; And she will respond there as in the days of her youth And as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，那日你必稱呼我：我的丈夫，不再稱呼我：巴力。<br>And in that day, declares Jehovah, You will call Me My Husband And will no longer call Me Baali.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>因為我必從她口中除掉諸巴力的名號，他們的名號不再被記念。<br>For I will take away the names of the Baals from her mouth, And they will no longer be  remembered by their name.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>當那日我必為我的民，與田野的走獸、空中的飛鳥、並地上的爬物立約；又必從那地折斷弓刀，止息爭戰，使他們安然躺臥。<br>And I will make a covenant for them In that day With the beasts of the field And with the birds of heaven And the creeping things of the  earth; And bow and sword and battle I will break from the land, And I will cause them to lie down in safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>我必聘你永遠歸我為妻，以公義和公平，以慈愛和憐恤聘你歸我；<br>And I will betroth you to Myself forever; Indeed I will betroth you to Myself In righteousness and justice And in lovingkindness and compassions;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>2:20</a></td><td class=td>也必以信實聘你歸我，你就必認識我耶和華。<br>Indeed I will betroth you to Myself in faithfulness, And you will know Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>2:21</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，那日我必應允；我必應允天，天必應允地，<br>And in that day I will answer, declares Jehovah; I will answer the heavens, And they will answer the earth,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>2:22</a></td><td class=td>地必應允五穀、新酒和新油，這些必應允耶斯列民。<br>And the earth will answer the grain And the new wine and the fresh oil, And they will answer Jezreel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>2:23</a></td><td class=td>我必將她播種在這地歸我，我必憐恤羅路哈瑪；我必對羅阿米說，你是我的民；他們必說，你是我的神。<br>And I will sow her for Myself in the  land; And I will have compassion on Lo-ruhamah, And I will say to Lo-ammi, You are My people; And they will say, My God.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
