<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>48:2</a></td><td class=td>摩押不再被稱讚；有人在希實本設計謀害她，說，來罷，我們將她剪除，使她不再成國。瑪得緬哪，你也必默默無聲；刀劍必緊隨著你。<br>The praise of Moab is no more; In Heshbon they have devised evil against her, saying: Come and let us cut her off from being a nation. You also, O Madmen, will be brought to silence; A sword will go after you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>48:3</a></td><td class=td>從何羅念有哀聲喊說，荒涼和大毀壞！<br>The sound of a cry from Horonaim, Desolation and great  destruction!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>48:4</a></td><td class=td>摩押毀壞了；她的孩童發哀聲，使人聽見。<br>Moab is destroyed; Her young have caused a cry to be heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>48:5</a></td><td class=td>人上魯希坡隨走隨哭；因為在何羅念的下坡，聽見毀壞的哀聲。<br>For by the ascent of Luhith Continual weeping will go up; For by the descent of Horonaim They have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>48:11</a></td><td class=td>摩押自幼年以來，常享安逸，如酒在渣滓上澄清，沒有從這器皿倒在那器皿裏，也未曾被遷徙；因此，他的原味尚存，香氣未變。<br>Moab has been at ease from his youth; And he is settled on his lees And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel; Nor has he gone into exile. Therefore his taste remains in him, And his scent is not changed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>48:12</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，因此日子將到，我必打發倒酒的往他那裏去，將他倒出來；倒空他的器皿，打碎他的壇子。<br>Therefore indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will send pourers to him, and they will pour and empty his vessels and shatter his jars.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>48:25</a></td><td class=td>摩押的角砍斷了，摩押的膀臂折斷了；這是耶和華說的。<br>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>48:26</a></td><td class=td>你們要使摩押沉醉，因他向耶和華誇大；他要在自己所吐之物中打滾，又要被人嗤笑。<br>Make him drunk, because he magnified himself against Jehovah; so Moab will wallow in his vomit and will also be in derision.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>48:27</a></td><td class=td>你豈不曾嗤笑以色列麼？他豈是在盜賊中間發現的麼？你每逢題到他便搖頭。<br>For was not Israel a derision to you? Or was he found among thieves? For as often as you speak of him, you shake your head.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>48:28</a></td><td class=td>摩押的居民哪，要離開城邑，住在岩石裏，像鴿子在坑口上搭窩。<br>Leave the cities and dwell in the  rock, O inhabitants of Moab, And be like a dove who nests On the sides of the mouth of the pit.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>48:29</a></td><td class=td>我們聽說摩押的驕傲，是極其驕傲；聽說過他的狂傲、驕傲、狂妄、並心中的高傲。<br>We have heard of the pride of  Moab-He is extremely proud-Of his loftiness and his pride and his arrogance And of the haughtiness of his  heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>48:30</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，我知道他的忿怒，他誇大的話是不正確的，是一無所成的。<br>I know of his insolence, declares Jehovah; His boastings are all untrue; They have accomplished nothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>48:31</a></td><td class=td>因此，我要為摩押哀號，為全摩押呼喊；人必為吉珥哈列設人哀歎。<br>Therefore I will wail for Moab, I will even cry out for all Moab; There will be mourning for the men of Kir-heres.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>48:32</a></td><td class=td>西比瑪的葡萄樹阿，我為你哀哭甚於雅謝人的哀哭；你的枝子蔓延過海，直達到海，達到雅謝；那行毀滅的，已經臨到你夏天的果子，和你所摘的葡萄。<br>With more than the weeping of Jazer I will weep for you, O vine of Sibmah. Your shoots have crossed over to the sea; They have reached as far as the sea, to Jazer; On your summer fruit and on your vintage The destroyer has fallen.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>48:33</a></td><td class=td>肥田和摩押地的喜樂歡騰，都被奪去。我使酒醡的酒絕流，無人踹酒，歡呼收成；收割的歡呼成了沒有收割的喊聲。<br>Rejoicing and exultation are taken away From the fruited field and from the land of Moab. And I have caused the wine from the wine presses to cease; No one will tread them with the harvest shout; The harvest shout will be no harvest shout.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>48:39</a></td><td class=td>摩押遭了何等的毀壞！他們哀號，摩押何等羞愧的轉背！因此，摩押必令四圍的眾人嗤笑、驚駭。<br>How it is shattered! they howl. How Moab has turned his back in shame! So Moab has become a derision and a terror to all who are around him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=40>48:40</a></td><td class=td>耶和華如此說，必有一人如大鷹撲下，展開翅膀攻擊摩押。<br>For thus says Jehovah, One will swoop down like an eagle And spread its wings against Moab.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=41>48:41</a></td><td class=td>加略被攻取，保障也被占據；到那日，摩押勇士的心必疼痛，如臨產婦人的心一樣。<br>Kerioth is captured, And the strongholds are seized, And the heart of the mighty men of Moab in that day Will be like the heart of a woman in labor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=42>48:42</a></td><td class=td>摩押必被毀滅，不再成一民，因他向耶和華誇大。<br>And Moab will be destroyed from being a people, Because he magnified himself against Jehovah.</td></tr>
