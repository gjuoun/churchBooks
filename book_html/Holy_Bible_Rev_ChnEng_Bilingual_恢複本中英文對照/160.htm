<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>7:1</a></td><td class=td>耶和華你神領你進入要得為業之地，從你麵前除掉許多國民，就是赫人、革迦撒人、亞摩利人、迦南人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人，共七國的民，都比你多、比你強。<br>When Jehovah your God brings you into the land which you are about to enter to possess, and clears away many nations from before you-the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, the Jebusites, seven nations more numerous and mightier than you -</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>7:2</a></td><td class=td>耶和華你神將他們交給你擊殺，那時你要把他們滅絕淨盡，不可與他們立約，也不可恩待他們。<br>And Jehovah your God delivers them up before you and you defeat them, you shall utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with them, nor shall you show them any favor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>7:3</a></td><td class=td>不可與他們結親：不可將你的女兒嫁給他們的兒子，也不可為你的兒子娶他們的女兒；<br>And you shall not make marriage alliances with them: Your daughters you shall not give to their sons, and their daughters you shall not take for your sons;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>7:4</a></td><td class=td>因為他們必使你兒子轉離不跟從我，去事奉別神，以致耶和華的怒氣向你們發作，就速速的將你們滅絕。<br>For they will draw your sons away from following after Me to serve other gods, and the anger of Jehovah will burn against you and He will quickly destroy you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>7:5</a></td><td class=td>你們卻要這樣待他們：拆毀他們的祭壇，打碎他們的柱像，砍下他們的木像，用火焚燒他們雕製的偶像。<br>But you shall deal with them in this way: Their altars you shall tear down, their pillars you shall shatter, their Asherahs you shall hew down, and their idols you shall burn with fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>7:6</a></td><td class=td>因為你是歸耶和華你神的聖別子民；耶和華你神從地上的萬民中揀選你，作祂自己的珍寶，作祂的子民。<br>For you are a holy people to Jehovah your God; it is you whom Jehovah your God has chosen from among all the peoples which are upon the face of the earth to be a people for His personal treasure.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>7:7</a></td><td class=td>耶和華鍾情於你們，揀選你們，並非因你們多於別民，原來你們在萬民中是最少的；<br>It was not because you were more numerous than all the peoples that Jehovah has set His affection on you and has chosen you, for you were the fewest of all the peoples;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>7:8</a></td><td class=td>乃因耶和華愛你們，又因要守祂向你們列祖所起的誓，就用大能的手領你們出來，把你們從為奴之家，從埃及王法老的手中救贖出來。<br>Rather, because Jehovah loved you and because He would keep the oath which He swore to your fathers, Jehovah has brought you out with a mighty hand and ransomed you from the slave house, from the hand of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>7:9</a></td><td class=td>所以你要知道，耶和華你的神是神，是信實的神，向愛祂、守祂誡命的人守約並施慈愛，直到千代；<br>Know therefore that it is Jehovah your God who is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and lovingkindness to the thousandth generation with those who love Him and keep His commandments,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>7:10</a></td><td class=td>向恨祂的人當麵報應他們，將他們滅絕。凡恨祂的人，祂必當麵報應，絕不遲延。<br>But repays directly those who hate Him by destroying them. He will not be slow toward him who hates Him; He will repay him directly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>7:11</a></td><td class=td>所以，你要謹守我今日所吩咐你遵行的誡命、律例和典章。<br>Therefore you shall keep the commandment, and the statutes and the judgments, which I am commanding you today to do.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>7:12</a></td><td class=td>你們若聽從這些典章，謹守遵行，耶和華你神就必照祂向你列祖所起的誓，向你守約並施慈愛。<br>And it will be that because you listen to these judgments, and keep them and do them, Jehovah your God will keep with you the covenant and the lovingkindness which He swore to your fathers.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>7:13</a></td><td class=td>祂必愛你，賜福與你，使你人數增多，也必在祂向你列祖起誓要賜給你的地上，賜福與你身所生的、地所產的，並你的五穀、新酒和新油，以及牛犢、羊羔。<br>And He will love you and bless you and multiply you; He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your fresh oil, the offspring of your cattle and the young of your flock, on the land which He swore to your fathers to give you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>7:14</a></td><td class=td>你必蒙福勝過萬民；你們的男女沒有不能生養的，牲畜也沒有不能生育的。<br>You will be more blessed than all other peoples; there will not be any barren male or female among you or among your animals.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>7:15</a></td><td class=td>耶和華必使一切的病症離開你；你所知道埃及各樣的惡疾，祂必不加在你身上，隻加給一切恨你的人。<br>And Jehovah will remove every sickness from you, and none of the evil illnesses of Egypt, which you know about, will He put upon you; but He will give them to all who hate you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>7:16</a></td><td class=td>耶和華你神所要交給你的一切人民，你要將他們除滅；你的眼不可憐惜他們。你也不可事奉他們的神，因這必成為你的網羅。<br>And you shall devour all the peoples which Jehovah your God is giving you; your eye shall not pity them, nor shall you serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>7:17</a></td><td class=td>你若心裏說，這些國的民比我多，我怎能趕出他們？<br>If you say in your heart, These nations are greater than I, how will I be able to dispossess them?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>7:18</a></td><td class=td>你不要懼怕他們，要牢牢記住耶和華你神向法老和全埃及所行的事，<br>You shall not be afraid of them; you must remember what Jehovah your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>7:19</a></td><td class=td>就是你親眼所看見的大試驗、神跡、奇事、大能的手、並伸出來的膀臂，都是耶和華你神領你出來所用的；耶和華你神必照樣對待你所懼怕的眾民。<br>The great trials that your eyes saw, and the signs and the wonders, and the mighty hand and the outstretched arm with which Jehovah your God brought you out; so will Jehovah your God do to all the peoples whom you are afraid of.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>7:20</a></td><td class=td>並且耶和華你神要打發大黃蜂到他們中間，直到那餘剩而從你麵前藏躲的人滅亡了。<br>Furthermore, Jehovah your God will send the hornet among them until those who are left and those who hide themselves from you are destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>7:21</a></td><td class=td>你不要因他們驚恐，因為耶和華你神在你們中間，祂是大而可畏的神。<br>You shall not be terrified of them, for Jehovah your God is in your midst, a great and awesome God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>7:22</a></td><td class=td>耶和華你神要漸漸的將這些國民從你麵前除掉；你不可把他們速速滅盡，免得田野的獸多起來害你。<br>And Jehovah your God will clear away these nations from before you little by little; you shall not devour all of them immediately, lest the beasts of the field multiply against you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>7:23</a></td><td class=td>耶和華你神必將他們交給你，大大的擾亂他們，直到他們滅絕了。<br>But Jehovah your God will deliver them up before you and rout them utterly until they are destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>7:24</a></td><td class=td>祂要將他們的君王交在你手中，你就使他們的名從天下消滅；必無一人能在你麵前站立得住，直到你將他們滅絕了。<br>And He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall destroy their name from under heaven; no man will be able to stand against you until you destroy them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>7:25</a></td><td class=td>他們雕製的神像，你們要用火焚燒；其上的金銀，你不可貪圖，也不可取為己有，免得你因此陷入網羅；這原是耶和華你神所憎惡的。<br>The idols of their gods you shall burn with fire; you shall not desire the silver or gold upon them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be ensnared by it; for it is an abomination to Jehovah your God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>7:26</a></td><td class=td>可憎的物，你不可帶進家裏，免得你成了當毀滅的，與那物一樣；你要十分厭惡它，十分憎嫌它，因為這是當毀滅的物。<br>And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, lest you become a cursed thing like it; you shall utterly detest it and utterly abhor it, for it is a cursed thing.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
