<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>21:1</a></td><td class=td>以色列人在米斯巴曾起誓說，我們都不將女兒給便雅憫人為妻。<br>Now the men of Israel swore in Mizpah, saying, None of us shall give his daughter to a Benjaminite as a wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>21:2</a></td><td class=td>百姓來到伯特利，在那裏坐在神麵前直到晚上，放聲痛哭，<br>And the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, and they lifted up their voice and wept greatly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>21:3</a></td><td class=td>說，耶和華以色列的神阿，今日以色列中缺了一支派，為何在以色列中發生這事呢？<br>And they said, Why, O Jehovah God of Israel, has this happened in Israel, that there is one tribe missing in Israel today?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>21:4</a></td><td class=td>次日百姓清早起來，在那裏築了一座壇，獻燔祭和平安祭。<br>And in the morning the people rose early and built an altar there, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>21:5</a></td><td class=td>以色列人彼此問說，以色列各支派中，誰沒有上到會眾中，到耶和華這裏來呢？先是以色列人起過大誓，論到凡不上米斯巴到耶和華麵前來的，說，那人必要被處死。<br>And the children of Israel said, Who did not come up into the congregation to Jehovah from all the tribes of Israel? For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who did not come up to Jehovah at Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>21:6</a></td><td class=td>以色列人為他們的弟兄便雅憫懊悔，說，今日以色列中有一支派被砍除了。<br>And the children of Israel were grieved concerning Benjamin their brother, and they said, Today a tribe has been cut down from Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>21:7</a></td><td class=td>我們既指著耶和華起誓說，必不將我們的女兒給便雅憫人為妻，現在我們當怎樣辦理，使他們剩下的人有妻子呢？<br>What shall we do about wives for those who remain, since we have sworn by Jehovah not to give them any of our daughters as wives?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>21:8</a></td><td class=td>又彼此問說，以色列支派中誰沒有上米斯巴到耶和華這裏來呢？他們就查出基列雅比沒有一人進營到會眾那裏；<br>And they said, Is there anyone from the tribes of Israel who did not come to Jehovah at Mizpah? Now there was no one from Jabesh-gilead who had come to the congregation at the camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>21:9</a></td><td class=td>因為百姓被數點的時候，沒有一個基列雅比的居民在那裏。<br>For when the people were numbered, there was no one from among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>21:10</a></td><td class=td>會眾就打發一萬二千勇士到那裏，吩咐他們說，你們去用刀將基列雅比的居民，連婦女帶孩子都擊殺了。<br>So the assembly sent twelve thousand of the valiant there and commanded them, saying, Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, including women and children.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>21:11</a></td><td class=td>所當行的就是這樣：要將一切男子和已嫁的女子盡都除滅。<br>And this is the thing that you shall do: Every male and every woman who has lain with a male you shall  utterly destroy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>21:12</a></td><td class=td>他們在基列雅比的居民中，遇見了四百個未嫁的年少處女，就帶到迦南地的示羅營裏。<br>And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, who had not known men by lying with a male; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which was in the land of Canaan.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>21:13</a></td><td class=td>全會眾打發人帶話到臨門磐石的便雅憫人那裏，向他們宣告和平。<br>And the whole assembly sent men and spoke to the children of Benjamin, who were at the rock of Rimmon; and they proclaimed peace to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>21:14</a></td><td class=td>當時便雅憫人回來了，以色列人就把所存活基列雅比的女子給他們為妻，但還是不彀。<br>And the Benjaminites returned at that time. And they gave them the women who had been kept alive from among the women of Jabesh-gilead; but there were not enough for them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>21:15</a></td><td class=td>百姓為便雅憫人懊悔，因為耶和華使以色列的支派中有了破口。<br>And the people were grieved concerning Benjamin, for Jehovah had made a breach among the tribes of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>21:16</a></td><td class=td>會眾的長老說，便雅憫中的女子既然除滅了，我們當怎樣辦理，使那餘剩的人有妻子呢？<br>So the elders of the assembly said, What shall we do about wives for those who remain, since the women are destroyed from Benjamin?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>21:17</a></td><td class=td>又說，便雅憫逃脫的人當有地業，免得以色列中塗抹了一個支派。<br>And they said, There should be some possession for those of Benjamin who have escaped, that no tribe would be blotted out of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>21:18</a></td><td class=td>隻是我們不能將自己的女兒給他們為妻；因為以色列人曾起誓說，那將女兒給便雅憫人為妻的，必受咒詛。<br>But we cannot give them any of our daughters as wives. For the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>21:19</a></td><td class=td>他們又說，看哪，在示羅年年有耶和華的節期。(示羅就在伯特利以北，從伯特利上示劍的大路以東，並利波拿以南。)<br>And they said, Behold, there is a feast of Jehovah each year in Shiloh (which is north of Bethel, on the east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah).</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>21:20</a></td><td class=td>於是吩咐便雅憫人說，你們去，在葡萄園中埋伏；<br>And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>21:21</a></td><td class=td>你們觀看，若見示羅的女子出來跳舞，就從葡萄園出來，在示羅的女子中各搶一個為妻，回便雅憫地去。<br>And right when you see the daughters of Shiloh coming out to dance in the dances, come out of the vineyards, and each of you shall catch his wife from the daughters of Shiloh; then go into the land of Benjamin.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>21:22</a></td><td class=td>他們的父親或弟兄若來與我們爭論，我們就對他們說，求你們施恩，將這些女子給我們，因我們在爭戰的時候沒有給他們各留下妻子。這也不是你們將女子給他們的；若是你們給的，你們如今就有罪過。<br>And when their fathers or brothers come to complain to us, we will say to them, Give them to us as a gift, for we did not take a wife in battle for each man, nor did you give them to them and thereby incur guilt for yourselves now.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>21:23</a></td><td class=td>於是便雅憫人照樣而行，按著他們的數目從跳舞的女子中搶去為妻，就回自己的地業去，又重修城邑居住。<br>And the children of Benjamin did so and took wives, whom they carried off, according to their number from those who danced. And they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>21:24</a></td><td class=td>當時以色列人離開那裏，各歸本支派、本家族；他們從那裏出去，各歸自己的地業去了。<br>And the children of Israel departed from there at that time, each man to his tribe and to his family; and they went forth from there, each man to his inheritance.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>21:25</a></td><td class=td>那些日子，以色列中沒有王，各人行自己眼中看為正的事。<br>In those days there was no king in Israel; each man did what was right in his own eyes.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
