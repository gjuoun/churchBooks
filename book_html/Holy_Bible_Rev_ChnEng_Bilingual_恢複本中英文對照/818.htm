<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>16:27</a></td><td class=td>看哪，我伸手攻擊你，減少你應得的糧食，又將你交給恨你的非利士眾女子，使她們任意待你；她們對你放蕩的行徑感到羞恥。<br>Indeed then I stretched out My hand over you and diminished the food apportioned to you; and I delivered you to the  desire of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>16:28</a></td><td class=td>你因還不滿足，又與亞述人行淫；與他們行淫之後，仍不滿足。<br>You also committed fornication with the sons of Assyria because you were not satisfied; and you committed fornication with them and were still not satisfied.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>16:29</a></td><td class=td>你又多行淫亂，直到那貿易之地，就是迦勒底，你仍不滿足。<br>Furthermore you multiplied your fornications into the land of merchants, Chaldea, yet you were still not satisfied by this.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>16:31</a></td><td class=td>你在各路口建造圓頂花樓，在各街市作了高台，你卻輕看酬價，不像妓女。<br>When you built your mound at the head of every street and you made your elevation in every open square, you were not like a harlot, by disdaining payment.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>16:34</a></td><td class=td>你行淫與別的婦女相反，因為不是人追求要與你行淫；你給人酬價，人並不給你酬價；所以你與別的婦女相反。<br>Thus you are perverse compared to other women in your fornications, in that they do not go after you as a prostitute, but you give payment and no payment is given to you; therefore you are perverse.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>16:35</a></td><td class=td>因此，你這妓女阿，要聽耶和華的話：<br>Therefore, you harlot, hear the word of Jehovah:</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>16:37</a></td><td class=td>所以我要將你一切所悅所愛的，連你一切所恨的，都聚集來，從四圍攻擊你；又將你的下體露出，使他們看盡了。<br>Therefore I am about to gather all your lovers whom you have pleased, indeed, all those whom you loved, with all those whom you hated; thus I will gather them against you from all around, and I will uncover your nakedness to them so that they may see all your nakedness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>16:38</a></td><td class=td>我也要審判你，像審判淫婦和流人血的婦女一樣；我要因忿怒妒忌，使流血的罪歸到你身上。<br>And I will judge you with the judgment that falls on adulterous women and on women who shed blood, and I will bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>16:39</a></td><td class=td>我又要將你交在他們手中；他們必拆毀你的圓頂花樓，毀壞你的高台，剝去你的衣服，奪取你的華美物件，留下你赤身露體。<br>And I will give you into their hand; and they will tear down your mounds and break down your elevations; they will also strip you of your garments and take your beautiful articles, and they will leave you naked and bare.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=42>16:42</a></td><td class=td>這樣，我就止息向你發的忿怒，我的妒忌也要離開你，我要安靜不再惱怒。<br>Thus I will cause My wrath against you to rest, and My jealousy will turn from you; and I will be quiet and angry no more.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=43>16:43</a></td><td class=td>因你不追念你幼年的日子，在這一切的事上向我發烈怒，所以在我這一麵，我必照你所行的報應在你頭上，你就不再在你一切可憎的事以外，又犯這淫行；這是主耶和華說的。<br>Because you have not remembered the days of your youth but have raged against Me in all these things, therefore, I, for My part, will bring your ways upon your head, declares the Lord Jehovah; and you will not commit this lewdness in addition to all your abominations.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=44>16:44</a></td><td class=td>凡說俗語的，必用俗語攻擊你，說，有其母，必有其女。<br>Indeed everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb concerning you, saying, As the mother is, so is her daughter.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=47>16:47</a></td><td class=td>你不是隻按她們所行的去行，也不是隻照她們可憎的事去作，你倒以那為小事，你一切所行的比她們更壞。<br>But you have not walked merely according to their ways and have not acted merely according to their abominations; but, as if such were too small a thing, you acted more corruptly in all your ways than they did.</td></tr>
