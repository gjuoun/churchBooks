<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>19:36</a></td><td class=td>這些事既是駁不倒的，你們就當安靜，不可鹵莽行事。<br>Since these things therefore cannot be disputed, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>19:37</a></td><td class=td>你們把這些人帶來，他們並沒有搶劫廟宇，也沒有謗讟我們的女神。<br>For you have brought forth these men who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>19:38</a></td><td class=td>若是底米丟和他同行的人，有控告人的事，自有上法庭的日期，也有省長在，他們盡可彼此對告。<br>If then Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a matter against anyone, courts are being conducted and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another. </td></tr>
