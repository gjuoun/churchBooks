<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>8:1</a></td><td class=td>伯沙撒王在位第三年，有異象顯與我但以理，是在起初所顯與我的異象之後。<br>In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that appeared to me at the beginning.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>8:2</a></td><td class=td>我在異象中觀看，正觀看時，我在以攔省書　城中；在異象中正觀看時，我在烏萊河邊。<br>And I looked in the vision, and while I looked, now I was in the fortress of Shushan, which is in the province of Elam; and while I looked in the vision, I was beside the river Ulai.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>8:3</a></td><td class=td>我舉目觀看，見有一隻雙角的公綿羊麵向河站著，兩角都高，這角高過那角，更高的是後長的。<br>Then I lifted my eyes, and I looked, and there was a ram, standing before the river, and he had two horns. And the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other; and the higher one came up last.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>8:4</a></td><td class=td>我見那公綿羊往西、往北、往南抵觸；獸在他麵前都站立不住，也沒有能救護脫離他手的，但他任意而行，漸漸強大。<br>I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward; and no beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could deliver from his  power; but he did as he pleased, and he became great.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>8:5</a></td><td class=td>我正思想的時候，見有一隻公山羊從西而來，遍行全地，腳不觸地；這山羊兩眼之間，有一顯著的角。<br>And while I considered this, there was a male goat, coming from the west over the face of the whole earth without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>8:6</a></td><td class=td>他往我所看見麵向河站著，有雙角的公綿羊那裏去，大發忿怒，向他直闖。<br>And he came up to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran toward him in his mighty wrath.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>8:7</a></td><td class=td>我見公山羊就近公綿羊，向他發烈怒，衝撞他，折斷他的兩角；綿羊無力抵擋他，被他撞倒在地，用腳踐踏；沒有能救綿羊脫離他手的。<br>And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged at him; and he struck the ram and broke his two horns; and the ram had no strength to withstand him, but the goat threw him down to the ground and trampled him; and there was none to deliver the ram from his power.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>8:8</a></td><td class=td>這山羊成為極其強大，正強盛的時候，那大角折斷了，在角根上向天的四方，長出四個顯著的角來。<br>And the male goat became very great. But once he became strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place four conspicuous ones came up toward the four winds of heaven.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>8:10</a></td><td class=td>他漸漸強大，高及天象，將些天象和星宿拋落在地，用腳踐踏。<br>And it grew great,  as high as the host of heaven; and it caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>8:11</a></td><td class=td>並且他漸漸強大，以為高及天象之君；祂日常的祭祀從祂除掉，祂的聖所被毀壞。<br>Indeed, he grew in greatness to that of the Prince of the host; and  from Him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of His sanctuary was thrown down.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>8:12</a></td><td class=td>因過犯的緣故，有軍兵和日常的祭祀交付與他；他將真理拋在地上，行事無不順利。<br>And an army was given to him together with the daily sacrifice because of transgression; and he cast truth down to the ground, and he took action and prospered.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>8:13</a></td><td class=td>我聽見有一位聖者說話，又有一位聖者問那說話的聖者，說，這除掉日常祭祀，和造成荒涼的過犯，以致聖所與軍兵遭踐踏的異象，要持續多久呢？<br>Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to the particular one who was speaking, How long will the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression that desolates apply, so that the sanctuary and the host are trampled down?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>8:14</a></td><td class=td>他對我說，到二千三百個日夜，聖所就必得潔淨。<br>And he said to me, For two thousand three hundred  nights and days; then the sanctuary will be  cleansed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>8:15</a></td><td class=td>我但以理見了這異象，尋求明白其中的意思，忽有一位樣子像人的，站在我麵前。<br>And when I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought an understanding of it; and immediately there was someone with an appearance like that of a man standing before me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>8:16</a></td><td class=td>我又聽見烏萊河兩岸間有人聲呼叫說，加百列阿，要使此人明白這異象。<br>And I heard the voice of a man between the banks of the Ulai; and He called out and said, Gabriel, cause this man to understand the vision.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>8:17</a></td><td class=td>他便來到我所站的地方；他一來，我就驚慌，麵伏於地；他對我說，人子阿，你要明白，這異象是關於末期的。<br>So he came near to where I stood; and when he came, I was afraid, and I fell on my face; but he said to me, Understand, O son of man, that the vision pertains to the end time.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>8:18</a></td><td class=td>他與我說話的時候，我麵伏在地沉睡了；但他摸我，扶我站在原地。<br>And as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep on my face upon the ground; but he touched me and made me stand in my place.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>8:19</a></td><td class=td>他說，我要使你知道惱怒末期必發生的事，因為這是關於末後的定期。<br>And he said, I now make known to you what will happen at the end of the indignation, for the vision pertains to the appointed time of the end.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>8:20</a></td><td class=td>你所看見雙角的公綿羊，就是瑪代和波斯王。<br>The ram that you saw, which had the two horns, are the kings of Media and Persia.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>8:21</a></td><td class=td>那多毛的公山羊，就是雅完王；牠兩眼之間的大角，就是頭一王。<br>And the hairy goat is the king of Javan; and the great horn which was between its eyes is the first king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>8:22</a></td><td class=td>至於那折斷了的角，及其根上長出的四角，乃是從這國裏興起來的四國，隻是力量都不及他。<br>And the broken horn and the four horns that arose in its place are four kingdoms that will arise from his nation, but not with his power.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>8:23</a></td><td class=td>在這四國末期，犯法的人罪惡滿盈，必有一王興起，麵貌凶惡，善用雙關的詐語。<br>And in the latter time of their kingdom, When the transgressors have filled up their transgressions, A king will arise, Of fierce countenance and skilled in ambiguities.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>8:24</a></td><td class=td>他的力量必強大，卻不是因自己的力量，他必行非常的毀滅，並且行事順利；又必毀滅有能力者和聖民。<br>And his power will be mighty, but not by his own power. And he will destroy in an extraordinary manner And will prosper and take action. He will destroy mighty men And the  holy people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>8:25</a></td><td class=td>他用權術使手中的詭計亨通；他心裏自高自大，在人坦然安定的時候，毀滅多人；又要站起來攻擊萬君之君，至終卻非因人手而被滅。<br>Through his craftiness He will also cause deceit to prosper in his hand; And he will magnify himself in his heart; And he will destroy many who are  complacently secure. And against the Prince of princes he will stand up; But he will be broken, yet not by human hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>8:26</a></td><td class=td>所說二千三百日夜的異象是真的，但你要將這異象封住，因為那是關於許多日子以後的事。<br>And the vision of the evenings and the mornings, Which has been told, is true. But shut the vision up, For it pertains to something many days from now.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>8:27</a></td><td class=td>於是我但以理疲憊力竭，病了數日，然後起來辦理王的事務；我因這異象驚奇，卻無人能解釋其中的意思。<br>Then I, Daniel, was spent, and I was sick for days. Then I arose and conducted the king's affairs; but I was astonished at the vision, and there was no one  to explain it.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
