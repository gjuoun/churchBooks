<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>18:2</a></td><td class=td>但人從瑣拉和以實陶打發全族中的五個勇士，去窺探偵察那地，對他們說，你們去偵察那地。他們來到以法蓮山地，到了米迦的住宅，就在那裏住宿。<br>So the children of Dan sent from their family five men from among all of them, men of valor, from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and search it out. And they said to them, Go and search out the land. And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah; and they lodged there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>18:3</a></td><td class=td>他們臨近米迦的住宅，認出那少年利未人的口音來，就轉進去對他說，誰領你到這裏來？你在這裏作什麼？你在這裏得什麼？<br>When they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite man, so they turned aside there and said to him, Who brought you here? And what are you doing in this place? And what do you have here?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>18:4</a></td><td class=td>他回答說，米迦待我如此如此，他雇了我作他的祭司。<br>And he said to them, Such and such has Micah done for me; and he has hired me to be his priest.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>18:7</a></td><td class=td>五個人就走了，來到拉億，見其中的民安然居住，如同西頓人平靜安然一樣；因為在那地沒有人掌權，使他們在什麼事上受屈辱；他們離西頓人也遠，與別人沒有來往。<br>Then the five men left and came to Laish. And they saw the people who were in it, dwelling securely after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no one in the land who possessed authority and might humble them in anything; and they were far from the Sidonians and had nothing to do with anyone.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>18:8</a></td><td class=td>五個人來到瑣拉和以實陶，見他們的弟兄；弟兄對他們說，你們有什麼話？<br>And they came to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol; and their brothers said to them, What can you say?</td></tr>

Is it better for you to be a priest for the house of one man or for you to be a priest for a tribe and family in Israel?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>18:20</a></td><td class=td>祭司心裏喜悅，便拿著以弗得、家中的神像並雕像，進入那些人中間。<br>And the priest's heart was glad; and he took the ephod and teraphim and the sculptured idol, and went into the midst of the people.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>18:26</a></td><td class=td>但人還是走他們的路。米迦見他們比自己強，就轉身回家去了。<br>And the children of Dan went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>18:27</a></td><td class=td>但人帶著米迦所製作的神像和他的祭司，來到拉億，到了平靜安然的民那裏，就用刀擊殺那民，又放火燒了那城，<br>So they took that which Micah had made and the priest that had been his, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure; and they struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>18:28</a></td><td class=td>並無人搭救；因為離西頓遠，他們又與別人沒有來往。城在靠近伯利合的山穀中。但人就重修那城，住在其中。<br>And there was no one to deliver it; for it was far from Sidon, and they had nothing to do with anyone. Now it was in the valley that is by Beth-rehob. And they rebuilt the city and dwelt in it.</td></tr>
