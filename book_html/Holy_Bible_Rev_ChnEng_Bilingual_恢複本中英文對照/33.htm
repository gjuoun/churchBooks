<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>33:1</a></td><td class=td>雅各舉目觀看，見以掃來了，同他一起的有四百人。他就把孩子們分開交給利亞、拉結、和兩個使女，<br>And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and there was Esau coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and among Rachel and among the two female servants.</td></tr>
