<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>8:1</a></td><td class=td>第六年六月初五日，我坐在家中，猶大的眾長老坐在我麵前，在那裏主耶和華的手臨到我身上。<br>And in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth of the month, as I sat in my house and the elders of Judah sat before me, the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell upon me there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>8:2</a></td><td class=td>我觀看，見有一形像，仿佛火的樣子：從祂腰以下有火的樣子，從祂腰以上有光輝的樣子，看來像光耀的金銀合金。<br>Then I looked, and there was a likeness like the appearance of fire: from His loins and downward, the appearance of fire; and from His loins and upward something like the appearance of brightness, like the sight of electrum.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>8:3</a></td><td class=td>祂伸出一隻手的樣式，抓住我的一綹頭發；靈就將我舉到天地之間，在神的異象中，帶我到耶路撒冷朝北的內院門口，在那裏有觸動主妒忌之偶像的座位，就是惹動妒忌的。<br>And He stretched out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and heaven and brought me to Jerusalem in the visions of God, to the entrance of the gate of the inner court that faces north, where the seat of the idol of jealousy was, which provokes to jealousy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>8:4</a></td><td class=td>在那裏有以色列神的榮耀，顯出來的樣子與我在平原所見的一樣。<br>And the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the appearance that I saw in the plain.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>8:5</a></td><td class=td>祂對我說，人子阿，你舉目向北觀看。我就舉目向北觀看，見祭壇門的北邊，在門口有這觸動主妒忌的偶像。<br>Then He said to me, Son of man, Lift up your eyes now toward the north. Thus I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and there, toward the north at the altar gate, was this idol of jealousy at the entry.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>8:6</a></td><td class=td>祂又對我說，人子阿，以色列家所行的，就是在這裏行這大大可憎的事，使我遠離我的聖所，你看見了麼？你還要看見更大可憎的事。<br>And He said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel is committing here, that I should be far from My sanctuary? But you will yet see greater abominations.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>8:7</a></td><td class=td>祂領我到院門口；我觀看，見牆上有一洞。<br>Then He brought me to the entrance of the court; and I looked, and there was a hole in the wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>8:8</a></td><td class=td>祂對我說，人子阿，你要挖牆。我一挖牆，見有一門。<br>And He said to me, Son of man, dig now through the wall. So I dug through the wall, and there was now an entrance.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>8:9</a></td><td class=td>祂說，你進去，看他們在這裏所行邪惡可憎的事。<br>And He said to me, Go and see the wicked abominations that they are committing here.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>8:10</a></td><td class=td>我進去觀看，見四麵牆上雕　各樣爬物和可憎走獸的像，並以色列家一切的偶像。<br>Thus I entered and looked, and there were every form of creeping thing and detestable beast and all the idols of the house of Israel, engraved on the wall all around.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>8:11</a></td><td class=td>在這些像前有以色列家的長老七十人站立，沙番的兒子雅撒尼亞也站在其中，各人手裏拿著自己的香爐，煙雲的香氣上騰。<br>And standing before them were seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them, each with his censer in his hand and the smell of the incense cloud went up.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>8:12</a></td><td class=td>祂對我說，人子阿，以色列家的長老，各人在雕像屋裏暗中所行的，你看見了麼？因他們說，耶和華看不見我們；耶和華已經離棄這地。<br>And He said to me, Do you see, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, each in the room of his engraved images? For they say, Jehovah does not see us; Jehovah has forsaken the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>8:13</a></td><td class=td>祂又說，你還要看見他們行更大可憎的事。<br>And He said to me, You will yet again see greater abominations that they are committing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>8:14</a></td><td class=td>於是祂領我到耶和華殿外院朝北的門口；在那裏有婦女坐著，為搭模斯哭泣。<br>Then He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the house of Jehovah that was toward the north; and women weeping for Tammuz were sitting there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>8:15</a></td><td class=td>祂對我說，人子阿，你看見了麼？你還要看見比這些更大可憎的事。<br>And He said to me, Do you see, son of man? You will yet again see greater abominations than these.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>8:16</a></td><td class=td>祂又領我到耶和華殿的內院；在耶和華的殿門口，在廊子和祭壇之間，約有二十五個人，背向耶和華的殿，麵向東方；他們正朝著東方拜日頭。<br>Then He brought me into the inner court of the house of Jehovah; and there, at the entrance of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah and their faces toward the east; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>8:17</a></td><td class=td>祂對我說，人子阿，你看見了麼？猶大家在這裏行這些可憎的事，豈是小事麼？他們又使這地滿了強暴，再三惹我發怒，看哪，他們手拿枝條舉向鼻前。<br>And He said to me, Do you see this, son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations that they commit here, that they also fill the land with violence and again and again provoke Me to anger? And now they are putting the branch to their nose.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>8:18</a></td><td class=td>因此，我也要在忿怒中行事。我眼必不顧惜，我也不可憐他們；他們雖向我耳中大聲呼求，我還是不聽。<br>Therefore I will also deal with them in wrath. My eye will not pity, nor will I spare; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not listen to them.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
