<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>18:1</a></td><td class=td>當時，門徒到耶穌跟前來，說，誰在諸天的國裏是最大的？<br>In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>18:2</a></td><td class=td>耶穌便叫一個小孩子來，站在他們中間，說，<br>And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>18:3</a></td><td class=td>我實在告訴你們，你們若不回轉，變成像小孩子一樣，絕不能進諸天的國。<br>And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>18:4</a></td><td class=td>所以凡降卑自己像這小孩子的，這人在諸天的國裏就是最大的。<br>He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>18:5</a></td><td class=td>凡因我的名，接待一個這樣小孩子的，就是接待我。<br>And whoever receives one such little child because of My name, receives Me; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>18:6</a></td><td class=td>凡絆跌一個信入我的小子的，倒不如把大磨石掛在他的脖子上，沉沒在深海裏。<br>And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe into Me, it is more profitable for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the open sea. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>18:7</a></td><td class=td>世界因著絆跌人的事有禍了；絆跌人的事是免不了的，但那絆跌人的有禍了。<br>Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it is necessary for stumbling blocks to come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>18:8</a></td><td class=td>若是你的手或你的腳絆跌你，就把它砍下來扔掉；你殘廢或瘸腿進入生命，比有兩手兩腳被扔在永火裏更好。<br>If your hand or your foot stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>18:9</a></td><td class=td>若是你的眼絆跌你，就把它剜出來扔掉；你隻有一隻眼進入生命，比有兩隻眼被扔在火坑裏更好。<br>And if your eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>18:10</a></td><td class=td>你們要當心，不可輕看這小子裏的一個。我告訴你們，他們的使者在諸天之上，常見我在諸天之上父的麵。<br>See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of My Father who is in the heavens. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>18:11</a></td><td class=td>因為人子來，是要拯救失喪的人。<br>For the Son of Man has come to save that which is lost. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>18:12</a></td><td class=td>你們怎麼看？一個人若有一百隻羊，其中一隻走迷了路，他豈不把這九十九隻撇在山上，去找那迷路的麼？<br>What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and seek the one that has gone astray? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>18:13</a></td><td class=td>若是找著了，我實在告訴你們，他為這一隻歡喜，比為那沒有迷路的九十九隻歡喜還大。<br>And if it so happens that he finds it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>18:14</a></td><td class=td>照樣，你們在諸天之上的父，也不願這小子裏失喪一個。<br>In the same way, it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones perish. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>18:15</a></td><td class=td>再者，若是你的弟兄犯罪得罪你，你要去，隻在你和他之間指出他的過錯。他若聽你，你就得著了你的弟兄。<br>Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>18:16</a></td><td class=td>他若不聽，你就另帶一兩個人同去，要憑兩三個見證人的口，句句都可定準。<br>But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>18:17</a></td><td class=td>他若不聽他們，就告訴召會；他若連召會也不聽，就把他當作外邦人和稅吏。<br>And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>18:18</a></td><td class=td>我實在告訴你們，凡你們在地上捆綁的，必是在諸天之上已經捆綁的；凡你們在地上釋放的，必是在諸天之上已經釋放的。<br>Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>18:19</a></td><td class=td>我又實在告訴你們，你們中間若有兩個人在地上，在他們所求的任何事上和諧一致，他們無論求什麼，都必從我在諸天之上的父，得著成全。<br>Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>18:21</a></td><td class=td>那時，彼得進前來，對耶穌說，主啊，我的弟兄得罪我，我當赦免他幾次？到七次麼？<br>Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>18:22</a></td><td class=td>耶穌對他說，我不是對你說到七次，乃是到七十個七次。<br>Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>18:23</a></td><td class=td>因此，諸天的國好比一個作君王的人，要和他的奴仆算賬。<br>For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to settle accounts with his slaves. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>18:24</a></td><td class=td>才算的時候，有人帶了一個欠一萬他連得銀子的來。<br>And when he began to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>18:25</a></td><td class=td>因為他沒有什麼可償還的，主人吩咐把他和他的妻子兒女，並一切所有的都賣了來償還。<br>But since he did not have the means to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>18:26</a></td><td class=td>那奴仆就俯伏拜他，說，寬容我，將來我都要還清。<br>Then the slave fell down and worshipped him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you all. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>18:27</a></td><td class=td>那奴仆的主人就動了慈心，把他釋放，並且免了他的債。<br>And the master of that slave was moved with compassion and released him and forgave him the loan. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>18:28</a></td><td class=td>但那奴仆出來，遇見一個和他同作奴仆的，欠他一百銀幣，便揪住他，掐住他的喉嚨，說，你所欠的，都要償還。<br>But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke him, saying, Repay me what you owe. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>18:29</a></td><td class=td>那和他同作奴仆的，俯伏央求他說，寬容我，將來我必還你。<br>Then his fellow slave fell down and begged him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you. </td></tr>
