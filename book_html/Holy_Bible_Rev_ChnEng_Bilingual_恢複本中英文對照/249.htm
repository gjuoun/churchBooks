<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>13:2</a></td><td class=td>就從以色列中為自己揀選了三千人，二千跟隨掃羅在密抹和伯特利山地，一千跟隨約拿單在便雅憫的基比亞；其餘的人掃羅都打發走，各回各的帳棚去了。<br>And Saul chose three thousand men from Israel for himself; and two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. And the rest of the people he sent away, every man to his tent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>13:3</a></td><td class=td>約拿單攻擊非利士人在迦巴的防營，非利士人聽見了。掃羅在遍地吹角，意思說，要使希伯來人聽見。<br>And Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard  of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>13:4</a></td><td class=td>以色列眾人聽見掃羅攻擊非利士人的防營，又聽見以色列人為非利士人所憎惡，於是百姓應召到吉甲跟隨掃羅。<br>And when all Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines and also that Israel had become odious to the Philistines, the people gathered themselves behind Saul at Gilgal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>13:5</a></td><td class=td>非利士人聚集，要與以色列人爭戰，有戰車三萬輛，馬兵六千，步兵像海邊的沙那樣多；他們上來在伯亞文東邊的密抹安營。<br>And the Philistines assembled themselves for battle with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people like the sand that is on the seashore in multitude. And they came up and encamped in Michmash, east of Beth- aven.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>13:6</a></td><td class=td>以色列人見自己危急，(因百姓大受窘迫，)就藏在山洞、叢林、磐石穴、地窖和坑中。<br>When the men of Israel saw that they were in distress (for the people were hard pressed), the people hid themselves in caves and in thickets and among rocks and in cellars and in pits.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>13:7</a></td><td class=td>有些希伯來人過了約但河，到迦得和基列地去；掃羅還是在吉甲，百姓都戰戰兢兢的跟隨他。<br>And some Hebrews crossed over the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead; but Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people trembled behind him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>13:8</a></td><td class=td>掃羅照著撒母耳所定的日期，等了七日；撒母耳還沒有來到吉甲，百姓也離開掃羅散去了。<br>And he waited for seven days, until the time appointed by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal. And the people scattered from him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>13:9</a></td><td class=td>掃羅說，把燔祭和平安祭帶到我這裏來。掃羅就獻上燔祭。<br>Then Saul said, Bring the burnt offering and the peace offerings to me. And he offered up the burnt offering.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>13:12</a></td><td class=td>我心裏就說，現在非利士人就要下到吉甲攻擊我，而我還沒有求耶和華的恩惠；所以我勉強獻上燔祭。<br>I said, Now the Philistines will come down on me at Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of Jehovah. Therefore I forced myself to offer up the burnt offering.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>13:13</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳對掃羅說，你作了糊塗事了，沒有遵守耶和華你神所吩咐你的命令。若遵守，耶和華必在以色列中堅立你的國，直到永遠；<br>Then Samuel said to Saul, You have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of Jehovah your God, which He commanded you. For now Jehovah would have established your kingdom over Israel forever;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>13:14</a></td><td class=td>但現在你的國必不得繼續存立。耶和華已經為自己尋著一個合乎祂心的人，耶和華已經立他作百姓的領袖，因為你沒有遵守耶和華所吩咐你的。<br>But now your kingdom will not continue. Jehovah has sought a man according to His heart for Himself, and Jehovah has appointed him ruler over His people; for you have not kept that which Jehovah commanded you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>13:15</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳就起來，從吉甲上到便雅憫的基比亞。掃羅點閱跟隨他的，約有六百人。<br>Then Samuel rose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul mustered the people who were with him, about six hundred men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>13:16</a></td><td class=td>掃羅和他兒子約拿單，並跟隨他們的人，都住在便雅憫的迦巴；但非利士人安營在密抹。<br>And Saul and Jonathan his son and the people who were with them dwelt in Geba of Benjamin, and the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>13:17</a></td><td class=td>有掠兵從非利士人的營中出來，分為三隊，一隊朝通到俄弗拉的路，往書亞地去，<br>And the raiders came out from the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual;</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>13:19</a></td><td class=td>那時，以色列全地找不到一個鐵匠，因為非利士人說，恐怕希伯來人製造刀槍。<br>Now there was no smith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>13:20</a></td><td class=td>以色列人都必須下到非利士人那裏去，修打各人的鋤、犁、斧、鏟。<br>Therefore all Israel would go down to the Philistines so that each might sharpen his plowshare or his mattock or his ax or his hoe.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>13:21</a></td><td class=td>修打鋤、打鋤犁、三齒叉和斧子，以及修理犁棒的費用是一舍克勒銀子的三分之二。<br>And the price was two-thirds of a shekel for plowshares and for mattocks and for three-pronged forks and for axes and for setting the goads.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>13:22</a></td><td class=td>所以到了爭戰的日子，跟隨掃羅和約拿單的人，沒有一個手裏有刀有槍的，惟獨掃羅和他兒子約拿單有。<br>So on the day of the battle there was not a sword or spear to be found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and with Jonathan, but  such were found with Saul and Jonathan his son.</td></tr>
