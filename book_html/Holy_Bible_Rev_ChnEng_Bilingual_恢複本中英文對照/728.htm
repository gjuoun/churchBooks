<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>49:1</a></td><td class=td>眾海島阿，當聽我言；遠方的眾民哪，要留心聽。從我在胎中，耶和華就呼召了我；從我在母腹中，祂就題我的名。<br>Listen to me, O coastlands, And hearken, you peoples from afar. Jehovah has called me from the  womb; From the bowels of my mother  He has made mention of my  name.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>49:2</a></td><td class=td>祂使我的口如快刀，將我藏在祂手蔭之下；又使我成為磨亮的箭，將我藏在祂箭袋之中。<br>And He has made my mouth like a sharp sword; He has concealed me in the shadow of His hand, And He has made me a polished arrow; He has hidden me in His quiver.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>49:3</a></td><td class=td>祂對我說，你是我的仆人以色列，我必因你得榮耀。<br>And He said to me, You are My servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>49:4</a></td><td class=td>我卻說，我勞碌是徒然，我盡力是虛無虛空；然而我當得的公理是在耶和華那裏，我的賞報是在我神那裏。<br>But I said, I have labored in vain; I have used up my strength for nothing and vanity; Yet surely the justice due to me is with Jehovah, And my recompense with my God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>49:5</a></td><td class=td>耶和華從我在胎中就塑造我作祂的仆人，要使雅各歸向祂，使以色列聚集到祂那裏；我要在耶和華眼中被看為尊榮，我的神也要成為我的力量。<br>And now says Jehovah, Who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant, To bring Jacob back to Him, So that Israel would be gathered to Him; And I will be glorified in the sight of Jehovah, And My God will be My strength.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>49:6</a></td><td class=td>祂說，你作我的仆人，使雅各眾支派複興，使以色列中得保全的歸回，尚為小事；我還要立你作外邦人的光，叫你施行我的救恩，直到地極。<br>He says, It is too small a thing that You would be My Servant To raise up the tribes of Jacob And bring back the preserved of Israel; I will also set You as a light of the  nations That You may be My salvation unto the ends of the earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>49:7</a></td><td class=td>以色列的救贖主，他的聖者耶和華，對那被人所藐視、本國所憎惡、統治者所奴役的，如此說，君王要看見就站起，首領也要下拜；都因信實的耶和華，就是揀選你以色列的聖者。<br>Thus says Jehovah,  The Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, To the despised One, the One abhorred by the nation, The One subjected to tyrants, Kings will see and arise, And princes will bow down; Because of Jehovah, who is faithful, The Holy One of Israel, who has chosen You.</td></tr>

As I live, declares Jehovah,  You will put all of them on like an ornament And gird yourself with them like a bride.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>49:19</a></td><td class=td>至於你荒廢淒涼之處，並你被毀壞之地，現今眾民居住必顯為太窄；吞滅你的必離你遙遠。<br>For your waste and desolate places And your devastated land-For you will be too constricted now because of its inhabitants, And those who swallowed you up will be far away.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>49:20</a></td><td class=td>你喪失的兒女還要在你耳中說，這地方對我太窄，求你給我豫備地方居住。<br>The children of whom you were bereaved Will yet say in your ears, This place is too constricted for me; Make room for me that I may dwell here.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>49:21</a></td><td class=td>那時你心裏必說，我既喪子又沒有生育，是被遷徙、趕逐在外的，誰給我生這些孩子？誰將他們養大？看哪，我被撇下獨自一人；這些孩子從那裏來呢？<br>Then you will say in your heart, Who has borne these for me, Since I have been bereaved of children and am barren,  An exile and driven about? And who brought these up? Indeed, I was left alone; From where did these come?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>49:22</a></td><td class=td>主耶和華如此說，我必向列國舉手，向眾民高舉我的旌旗；他們必將你的眾子抱在懷中帶來，將你的眾女放在肩上扛來。<br>Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Indeed, I will lift up My hand to the nations, And unto the peoples I will lift up My banner; And they will bring your sons in their arms, And they will carry your daughters on their shoulders.</td></tr>
