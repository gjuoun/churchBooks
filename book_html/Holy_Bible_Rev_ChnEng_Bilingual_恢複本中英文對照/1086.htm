<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>8:1</a></td><td class=td>還有，弟兄們，我們把神在馬其頓眾召會中所賜的恩典告訴你們，<br>Furthermore we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>8:2</a></td><td class=td>就是在患難中受大試驗的時候，他們充盈的喜樂，和極深的貧困，彙溢出豐厚的慷慨。<br>That in much proving of affliction the abundance of their joy and the depth of their poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>8:3</a></td><td class=td>我可以見證，他們是按著能力，而且也過了能力，<br>That according to their power, I testify, and beyond their power, of their own accord, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>8:4</a></td><td class=td>自願的多方懇求，向我們要求這供給聖徒的恩典和交通，<br>With much entreaty they besought of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>8:5</a></td><td class=td>並且他們未照著我們所盼望的，反而憑著神的旨意，先把自己給了主，也給了我們，<br>And this, not as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us through the will of God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>8:6</a></td><td class=td>以致我們勸提多，他怎樣開始了，也當照樣為你們完成這恩典，像完成其他的事一樣。<br>So we entreated Titus that, even as he began before, so also he would complete for you this grace as well. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>8:7</a></td><td class=td>但你們當在這恩典上也充盈滿溢，像你們在凡事上，在信心，在言語，在知識，在一切的熱誠，並在那出於我們而在你們裏麵的愛心上，都充盈滿溢一樣。<br>But just as you abound in everything, in faith and in word and in knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love in you from us, abound in this grace also. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>8:8</a></td><td class=td>我說這話，不是命令你們，乃是藉著別人的熱誠，也試驗你們愛的真實。<br>I am not speaking by way of command but through the earnestness of others, proving also the genuineness of your love. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>8:9</a></td><td class=td>你們知道我們主耶穌基督的恩典，祂本來富足，卻為你們成了貧窮，叫你們因祂的貧窮，可以成為富足。<br>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, for your sakes He became poor in order that you, because of His poverty, might become rich. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>8:10</a></td><td class=td>我在這事上提出意見，因這是與你們有益的；你們不但在實行上，也在意願上，在一年前就先開始了，<br>And I give my opinion in this matter, for this is profitable for you who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do this but even to intend to do this. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>8:11</a></td><td class=td>如今也當辦成這事，好叫你們怎樣有願作的熱切，也怎樣照所有的辦成，<br>But now complete also the doing, so that as there was the eagerness in intending, so also there would be the completing out of what you have. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>8:12</a></td><td class=td>因為人若熱切願作，必蒙悅納，乃是照他所有的，不是照他所無的。<br>For if the eagerness is there, it is acceptable according to whatever one has, not according to what he does not have. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>8:13</a></td><td class=td>這原不是要別人輕省，你們為難，<br>For it is not that to others there would be relief, yet to you affliction, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>8:14</a></td><td class=td>乃是要出於均平，就是要你們的富餘，今時可以補他們的不足，為使他們的富餘，將來也可以補你們的不足，這就均平了；<br>But it is out of equality; at the present time your abundance for their lack that their abundance also may be for your lack, so that there may be equality; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>8:15</a></td><td class=td>如經上所記：“多收的沒有餘，少收的也沒有缺。”<br>As it is written, "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>8:16</a></td><td class=td>感謝神，把我為你們同樣的熱誠，賜在提多心裏，<br>But thanks be to God who puts the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>8:17</a></td><td class=td>因他固然接受了懇求，但自己更是熱誠，自願往你們那裏去。<br>Because he not only received the entreaty, but being more earnest, he also went forth of his own accord to you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>8:18</a></td><td class=td>我們還打發一位弟兄和他同去，這人在福音上普遍的為眾召會所稱讚。<br>And we sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the churches, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>8:19</a></td><td class=td>不但這樣，他也被眾召會選出，在我們所服事的這恩典上，和我們同行，是為著主自己的榮耀，也是為著我們的熱切。<br>And not only this, but who has also been  by the churches as our fellow traveler in this grace which is being ministered by us, to the glory of the Lord Himself and to demonstrate our eagerness; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>8:20</a></td><td class=td>這就避免人在我們所服事的這豐裕上，挑剔我們，<br>Avoiding this, that anyone should find fault with us in this abundance which is being ministered by us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>8:21</a></td><td class=td>因為我們留心作善美可敬的事，不但在主麵前，也在人麵前。<br>For we exercise foresight for what is honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>8:22</a></td><td class=td>我們又打發我們的弟兄和他們同去，這人是我們在許多事上，屢次試證為殷勤的，現在他因對你們極其深信，就極其更加殷勤了。<br>And we sent with them our brother, whom we have proved to be diligent in many things many times, yet now much more diligent because of the great confidence he has toward you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>8:23</a></td><td class=td>論到提多，他是我的同夥和為著你們的同工；至於我們的弟兄們，他們是眾召會的使徒，是基督的榮耀。<br>Whether concerning Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you; or our brothers, they are apostles of the churches, they are Christ's glory. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>8:24</a></td><td class=td>所以你們要在眾召會麵前，向他們顯示你們愛心的明證，並我們為你們誇耀的明證。<br>Show therefore to them, in the face of the churches, the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
