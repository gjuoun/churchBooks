<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>48:1</a></td><td class=td>雅各家，名稱為以色列，從猶大水源出來的，當聽這話；你們指著耶和華的名起誓，題說以色列的神，卻不憑真實，不憑公義。<br>Hear this, O house of Jacob, Who are called by the name of Israel; And who came out from the waters of Judah, Who swear by the name of Jehovah And make mention of the God of Israel, But not in truth nor in  righteousness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>48:2</a></td><td class=td>你們自稱為聖城的人，所信靠的是以色列的神；萬軍之耶和華是祂的名。<br>For they call themselves after the holy city And lean upon the God of  Israel; Jehovah of hosts is His name.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>48:3</a></td><td class=td>主說，早先的事我從起初說明，已經出了我的口，也叫人聽見了；我忽然行作，事便成就。<br>I have declared the former things from the beginning; And they went out from My mouth, and I let them hear  them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>48:4</a></td><td class=td>因為我素來知道你是頑梗的，你的頸項是鐵筋，你的額是銅的；<br>Because I knew that you are obstinate, And your neck is an iron sinew, And your forehead brass;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>48:5</a></td><td class=td>所以我從古時給你說明，在未成以先就說給你聽；免得你說，這些事是我的偶像所行的，是我雕製的偶像和我鑄造的偶像所命定的。<br>Therefore I declared them to you long ago; Before things came to pass I let you hear; Lest you should say, My idol has done them, And my graven image and my molten image commanded  them.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>48:8</a></td><td class=td>你未曾聽見，未曾知道，你的耳朵從起初也未曾開通；我原知道你行事極其詭詐，你從母腹裏便稱為悖逆的。<br>You also have not heard and have not known; Your ears were not even open from that time; For I knew that you would deal very treacherously And would be called a transgressor from the womb.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>48:10</a></td><td class=td>看哪，我熬煉你，卻不像熬煉銀子；你在苦難的爐中，我試煉你。<br>Indeed, I have refined you but not like silver; I have tried you in the furnace of affliction.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>48:11</a></td><td class=td>我為自己的緣故，為自己的緣故，必行這事，我的名焉能被褻瀆？我必不將我的榮耀歸給別神。<br>For My own sake, yes, for My own sake, I will do it, For how can My name be  profaned? And I will not give My glory to another.</td></tr>

And now the Lord Jehovah  Has sent me and His Spirit.</td></tr>
