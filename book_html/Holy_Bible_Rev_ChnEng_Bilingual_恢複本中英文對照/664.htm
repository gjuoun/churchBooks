<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>5:1</a></td><td class=td>你到神的殿要謹慎腳步；近前聆聽，勝過愚昧人獻祭；因為他們不知道所作的是惡。<br>Guard your steps when you go to the house of God, and draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools; for they do not know that they are doing evil.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>5:2</a></td><td class=td>你在神麵前不可冒失開口，也不可心急發言；因為神在天上，你在地上，所以你的言語要寡少。<br>Do not be rash with your mouth, and let not your heart hastily utter anything before God; for God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>5:3</a></td><td class=td>煩擾多，令人作夢；言語多，顯出愚昧。<br>For a dream comes through a multitude of travail, and a fool's voice through a multitude of words.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>5:4</a></td><td class=td>你向神許願，償還不可遲延，因祂不喜悅愚昧人。你許了願，就當償還。<br>When you make a vow to God, do not delay in paying it; for He takes no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>5:5</a></td><td class=td>你許願不還，不如不許。<br>It is better that you do not vow than that you vow and not pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>5:6</a></td><td class=td>不可任你的口使肉體犯罪，也不可在使者麵前說是錯許了。為何使神因你的聲音發怒，敗壞你手所作的呢？<br>Do not let your mouth cause your flesh to sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the works of your hands?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>5:7</a></td><td class=td>多夢和多言，其中也都是虛空；你隻要敬畏神。<br>For in the multitude of dreams and in many words are also vanities. Rather, fear God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>5:8</a></td><td class=td>你若在一省之中見窮人受欺壓，公義和公理被奪去，不要因此詫異；因有一位高過居高位的在鑒察；在他們以上還有更高的。<br>If you see the oppression of the poor and the wresting of justice and righteousness in a province, do not be astonished at the matter; for one higher official watches over another high official, and there are higher officials over them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>5:9</a></td><td class=td>君王注重田地的耕種，對國總是有益。<br>And a king who cultivates the field is always an advantage for a land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>5:10</a></td><td class=td>愛銀子的，不因得銀子知足；愛豐富的，也不因有收入知足。這也是虛空。<br>He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver, nor he who loves abundance with income. This is also vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>5:11</a></td><td class=td>貨物增多，吃的人也增多，物主得什麼益處呢？不過眼看而已。<br>When goods increase, those who eat them increase; so what advantage do their owners have except to see them with their eyes?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>5:12</a></td><td class=td>勞力的人不拘吃多吃少，睡得香甜；富足人的豐足，卻不容他睡覺。<br>Sweet is the sleep of the laborer, whether he eats little or much; but the fullness of the rich will not let him sleep.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>5:13</a></td><td class=td>我見日光之下有一大禍患，就是財主守住財富，反害自己。<br>There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches kept by their owner to his own hurt,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>5:14</a></td><td class=td>因生意不順，這些財富就喪失；那人若生了兒子，手裏也一無所有。<br>And those riches were lost in a bad venture; and having begotten a son, he had nothing in his hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>5:15</a></td><td class=td>他怎樣出母腹赤身而來，也必照樣赤身而去；他所勞碌得來的，手中分毫不能帶去。<br>As he came forth from his mother's womb, he will return naked as he came; and he will take nothing of his labor that he may carry in his hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>5:16</a></td><td class=td>他來的情形怎樣，他去的情形也怎樣，這也是一大禍患；他為風勞碌有什麼益處呢？<br>And this also is a grievous evil: in all points, as he came, so will he go; so what is the advantage to him who has labored for the wind?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>5:17</a></td><td class=td>他終身在黑暗中吃喝，多有煩惱、病痛、憤怨。<br>Throughout all his days he also eats in darkness and has much vexation and sickness and resentment.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>5:18</a></td><td class=td>我所見為善為美的，就是人在神賜他一生有數的日子吃喝，在日光之下一切勞碌中享美福，因為這是他的分。<br>Here is what I have seen to be good and what is pleasant: to eat and to drink and to taste enjoyment in all his labor by which he labors under the sun during the few days of his life, which God has given him; for this is his portion.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>5:19</a></td><td class=td>神賜各人貲財豐富，使他能以吃用，能取自己的分，在他勞碌中快樂，這乃是神的恩賜。<br>Moreover, for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has empowered him to eat of them and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labor-this is the gift of God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>5:20</a></td><td class=td>他不多思念自己一生的日子，因為神使他的心忙於享樂。<br>For he will not  brood much over the days of his life, because God keeps him occupied with the gladness of his heart.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
