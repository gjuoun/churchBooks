<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>亞達薛西王二十年尼散月，有酒擺在王麵前，我拿起酒來奉給王。我素來在他麵前沒有愁容。<br>Then in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, while wine was being set before him, I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never been sad in his presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>王對我說，你既沒有病，為什麼麵帶愁容呢？這不是別的，必是你心中愁煩。於是我甚懼怕。<br>And the king said to me, Why is your face sad, since you are not ill? This is nothing other than sadness of heart. Then I was greatly frightened.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>我對王說，願王萬歲！我列祖墳墓所在的那城荒涼，城門被火焚燒，我豈能麵無愁容呢？<br>And I said to the king, May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' graves, lies in waste and its gates are consumed with fire?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>王問我說，你要求什麼？於是我禱告天上的神。<br>And the king said to me, What do you request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>我對王說，王若以為美，仆人若在王麵前蒙恩惠，求王差遣我往猶大，到我列祖墳墓所在的城去，我好重新建造那城。<br>And I said to the king, If it please the king and if your servant has found favor before you, that you would send me to Judah to the city of my fathers' graves that I may rebuild it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>那時王後坐在王的旁邊。王問我說，你去需時多久？幾時回來？王喜歡差遣我去，我也把日期告訴了王。<br>And the king said to me (and the queen was sitting beside him), How long will your going be, and when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a date.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>我又對王說，王若以為美，請賜我詔書，通知大河以西的諸省長準我經過，直到我抵達猶大；<br>Then I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given to me for the governors beyond the River, so that they will let me pass through until I come to Judah;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>又賜詔書，通知看守王園林的亞薩，使他給我木料，作屬殿營樓之門的橫梁，並供城牆和我要住的房屋使用。因我神美善的手幫助我，王就把我所求的賜給我。<br>And a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the Park, which belongs to the king, so that he would give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace that belongs to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that I will be entering. And the king gave these to me according to the good hand of my God, which was upon me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>王派了軍長和馬兵護送我。我到了河西的諸省長那裏，將王的詔書交給他們。<br>So I went to the governors beyond the River and gave them the king's letters. And the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>和倫人參巴拉，並作臣仆的亞捫人多比雅，聽見有人來為以色列人求好處，就甚惱怒。<br>And when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard of this, it displeased them greatly that a man had come seeking the good of the children of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>我到了耶路撒冷，在那裏住了三日。<br>Thus I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>我夜間起來，有幾個人也一同起來；但神使我心裏起意要為耶路撒冷作什麼事，我並沒有告訴人。除了我騎的牲口以外，也沒有別的牲口在我那裏。<br>And I arose at night, I and some few men with me. And I told no man what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. And there was no animal with me except the animal I rode on.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>當夜我出了穀門，往野狗泉去，到了糞門，察看耶路撒冷的城牆，見城牆被拆毀，城門被火焚燒。<br>And I went out at night by the Valley Gate, toward the Jackals' Spring and the Dung Gate, and inspected the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down and whose gates had been consumed with fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>我又往前，到了泉門和王池，但所騎的牲口沒有地方過去。<br>Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool, but there was no place for the animal under me to pass through.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>於是我在夜間沿溪而上，察看城牆，又轉身進入穀門，就回來了。<br>And I went up at night by the brook and inspected the wall, and turned back and went in by the Valley Gate and so returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>我去過那裏，作了什麼事，官長都不知道；我還沒有告訴猶大人、祭司、貴胄、官長、和其餘作工的人。<br>And the rulers did not know where I had gone or what I had been doing; and I had not as yet told it to the Jews and the priests and the nobles and the rulers and the rest who were to do the work.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>以後，我對他們說，我們所遭的禍患，耶路撒冷怎樣荒涼，城門被火焚燒，你們都看見了。來罷，我們重建耶路撒冷的城牆，免得再受淩辱。<br>Then I said to them, You see the bad state we are in, that Jerusalem lies in waste and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a reproach.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>我告訴他們，我神美善的手怎樣幫助我，也把王對我所說的話告訴他們。他們就說，我們起來建造罷；於是他們奮勇作這善工。<br>And I told them about the hand of my God, which was good upon me, and also about the king's words, which he had spoken to me. And they said, Let us rise up and build; and they strengthened their hands for the good work.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>但和倫人參巴拉、作臣仆的亞捫人多比雅、和亞拉伯人基善聽見，就嗤笑我們，藐視我們，說，你們作的是什麼事？你們要背叛王麼？<br>But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant and Geshem the Arabian heard of it, they mocked us and despised us; and they said, What is this thing that you will do? Will you rebel against the king?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>2:20</a></td><td class=td>我回答他們說，天上的神必親自使我們亨通；所以我們作祂仆人的，要起來建造。你們卻在耶路撒冷無分、無權、無記念。<br>And I answered them and said to them, The God of heaven Himself will make us prosper; therefore we His servants will rise up and build. But you have no portion nor right nor memorial in Jerusalem.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
