<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>24:2</a></td><td class=td>王對跟隨他的軍隊元帥約押說，你去走遍以色列眾支派，從但直到別是巴，數點百姓，我好知道百姓的數目。<br>And the king said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with him, Go now throughout all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beer-sheba, and count the people, that I may know the number of the people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>24:3</a></td><td class=td>約押對王說，無論百姓有多少，願耶和華你的神再加增百倍，使我主我王親眼得見。我主我王何必喜悅行這事呢？<br>And Joab said to the king, Now may Jehovah your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are, while the eyes of my lord the king may see  it. But why does my lord the king desire this thing?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>24:4</a></td><td class=td>但王的話勝過約押和眾軍長。約押和眾軍長就從王麵前出去，數點以色列的百姓。<br>Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the army. And Joab and the captains of the army went forth before the king to count the people  of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>24:5</a></td><td class=td>他們過了約但河，在河穀中，城右邊的亞羅珥安營，向迦得和雅謝走去，<br>And they crossed the Jordan and encamped at Aroer to the right of the city, which was in the midst of the river valley, toward Gad and unto Jazer.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>24:7</a></td><td class=td>他們來到推羅的保障，並希未人和迦南人所有的城市，又到猶大南方的別是巴。<br>And they came to the stronghold of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites, and they went on to the south of Judah at Beer-sheba.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>24:8</a></td><td class=td>他們走遍全地，過了九個月零二十天，就回到耶路撒冷。<br>And when they had gone about throughout all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>24:10</a></td><td class=td>大衛數算百姓以後，心中自責，就對耶和華說，我行這事是犯大罪了；耶和華阿，現今求你除掉仆人的罪孽，因我所行的甚是愚昧。<br>And David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people. And David said to Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now, O Jehovah, put away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>24:11</a></td><td class=td>大衛早晨起來，耶和華的話臨到申言者迦得，就是大衛的先見，說，<br>And when David rose up in the morning, the word of Jehovah came to Gad the prophet, David's seer, saying,</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>24:13</a></td><td class=td>於是迦得來見大衛，把這些災告訴他，對他說，你願意在你的地上有七年的饑荒臨到呢？是你在敵人麵前逃跑，被追趕三個月呢？是在你的地上有三日的瘟疫呢？現在你要思想，看看我該用什麼話回覆那差我來的。<br>So Gad went to David and told him  these things. And he said to him, Shall seven years of famine come upon you in your land? Or shall you flee before your adversaries for three months while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days of pestilence in your land? Consider now and see what word I should return to Him who sent me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>24:14</a></td><td class=td>大衛對迦得說，我甚為難；我們願落在耶和華的手裏，因為祂有豐盛的憐恤；我不願落在人的手裏。<br>And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait; let us fall into the hand of Jehovah, for His compassions are great; and do not let me fall into the hand of man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>24:15</a></td><td class=td>於是，耶和華降瘟疫於以色列，自早晨到所定的時候；從但直到別是巴，百姓中死了七萬人。<br>So Jehovah sent a pestilence in Israel from the morning until the appointed time; and seventy thousand people died among the people from Dan to Beer-sheba.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>24:16</a></td><td class=td>天使向耶路撒冷伸手要滅城的時候，耶和華就後悔不降這災；祂對滅民的天使說，彀了，現在住手罷。那時，耶和華的使者在耶布斯人亞勞拿的禾場附近。<br>And when the angel stretched forth his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah repented of the harm. And He said to the angel who destroyed the people, It is enough; now hold back your hand. And the angel of Jehovah was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>24:17</a></td><td class=td>大衛看見那擊殺百姓的天使，就對耶和華說，是我犯了罪，是我行了惡；但這群羊作了什麼呢？願你的手攻擊我和我的父家。<br>And David spoke to Jehovah when he saw the angel striking the people and said, It is I who have sinned, and it is I who have acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, be against me and against the house of my father.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>24:18</a></td><td class=td>當日，迦得來見大衛，對他說，你上去，在耶布斯人亞勞拿的禾場上，為耶和華立一座壇。<br>And Gad came to David on that day; and he said to him, Go up  and raise up an altar to Jehovah on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>24:19</a></td><td class=td>大衛就照著迦得的話，就是耶和華所吩咐的，上去了。<br>And David went up according to Gad's word, as Jehovah had commanded.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>24:21</a></td><td class=td>說，我主我王為何來到仆人這裏呢？大衛說，我要向你買這禾場，為耶和華築一座壇，使百姓中的災疫止住。<br>And Araunah said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing floor from you to build an altar to Jehovah, that the plague may be stayed among the people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>24:22</a></td><td class=td>亞勞拿對大衛說，我主我王看什麼為好，就拿去獻上罷。看哪，這裏有牛可以作燔祭，有打糧的器具和套牛的軛可以當柴燒。<br>And Araunah said to David, May my lord the king take and offer up whatever seems good in his sight. Look, the oxen for the burnt offering and the threshing instruments and the yokes for the oxen for the wood -</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>24:23</a></td><td class=td>王阿，這一切，我亞勞拿都奉給你；又對王說，願耶和華你的神悅納你。<br>All this, O king, does Araunah give to the king. Then Araunah said to the king, May Jehovah your God accept you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>24:24</a></td><td class=td>王對亞勞拿說，不然；我必按著價值向你買，我不願用白得之物作燔祭獻給耶和華我的神。大衛就用五十舍客勒銀子買了那禾場與牛。<br>But the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy  it from you for a price, and I will not offer to Jehovah my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>24:25</a></td><td class=td>大衛在那裏為耶和華築了一座壇，獻燔祭和平安祭。如此，耶和華應允國民為那地所懇求的，災疫在以色列人中就止住了。<br>And there David built an altar to Jehovah, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And Jehovah responded to the entreaty for the land, and the plague was stayed in Israel.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
