<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>17:2</a></td><td class=td>保羅照他素常的規矩進到他們那裏，一連三個安息日，本著聖經與他們辯論，<br>And according to his custom Paul went in to them, and on three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>17:3</a></td><td class=td>講解陳明基督必須受害，並從死人中複活，又說，我所傳與你們的這位耶穌，就是基督。<br>Opening and setting before them that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead, and saying, This is the Christ, the Jesus whom I announce to you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>17:4</a></td><td class=td>他們中間有些人信服了，就附從保羅和西拉，並有許多敬神的希利尼人，首要的婦女也不少。<br>And some of them were persuaded and were joined to Paul and Silas, as well as a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and of the chief women not a few. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>17:5</a></td><td class=td>但猶太人嫉妒起來，招聚了一些市井匪類，結夥成群，騷動那城，又闖進耶孫的家，想要將保羅、西拉帶到民眾那裏；<br>But the Jews, becoming jealous and taking along some evil men from among the loafers in the marketplace, gathered a crowd and set the city in an uproar; and coming upon the house of Jason, they sought to bring them to the populace. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>17:6</a></td><td class=td>隻是找不著他們，就把耶孫和幾位弟兄，拉到地方官那裏，喊叫著說，這些擾亂天下的，也到這裏來了，<br>But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brothers before the city officials, shouting, These men who have upset the world have come here also, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>17:7</a></td><td class=td>耶孫竟然接待他們。這些人行事都違背該撒的詔諭，說另有一個王耶穌。<br>Whom Jason has welcomed; and these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>17:8</a></td><td class=td>群眾和地方官聽見他們這話，就驚慌了。<br>And they stirred up the crowd and the city officials, who listened to these things. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>17:9</a></td><td class=td>於是向耶孫和其餘的人取了保狀，就釋放了他們。<br>And when they had taken bail from Jason and the rest, they released them. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>17:10</a></td><td class=td>弟兄們隨即在夜間打發保羅和西拉往庇哩亞去，二人到了，就進入猶太人的會堂。<br>And the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away during the night to Berea, who, when they arrived, went off into the synagogue of the JEWS. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>17:11</a></td><td class=td>這裏的人比帖撒羅尼迦的人開明，他們熱切的領受這道，天天考查聖經，要曉得這些事是否這樣。<br>Now these people were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>17:12</a></td><td class=td>所以他們中間多有信的，又有尊貴的希利尼婦女，男人也不少。<br>Therefore many of them believed, and there were not a few Greek women of high standing and men. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>17:13</a></td><td class=td>但帖撒羅尼迦的猶太人，知道保羅又在庇哩亞宣傳神的話，也就往那裏去，聳動擾亂群眾。<br>But when the Jews from Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been announced by Paul in Berea also, they came there as well, agitating and stirring up the crowds. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>17:14</a></td><td class=td>當時弟兄們便立刻打發保羅往海邊去，西拉和提摩太仍留在庇哩亞。<br>And immediately the brothers then sent Paul off, to go as far as the sea; and Silas and Timothy remained there. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>17:15</a></td><td class=td>護送保羅的人帶他到了雅典；既領了保羅給西拉和提摩太的命令，叫他們趕緊到他這裏來，就回去了。<br>And those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible, they went off. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>17:16</a></td><td class=td>保羅在雅典等候他們的時候，看見滿城都是偶像，他裏麵的靈就受到激憤。<br>And while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld that the city was full of idols. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>17:17</a></td><td class=td>於是在會堂裏，與猶太人和敬神的人辯論，也與每日在市場上所遇見的人辯論。<br>He reasoned therefore in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>17:18</a></td><td class=td>還有一些以彼古羅和斯多亞的哲學家，與他爭論，有的說，這胡言亂語的想要說什麼？有的說，他似乎是傳說異邦鬼神的。這話是因保羅傳揚耶穌與複活為福音。<br>And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also confronted him. And some said, What would this babbler wish to say? And others, He seems to be an announcer of foreign deities -- because he was announcing Jesus and the resurrection as the gospel. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>17:19</a></td><td class=td>他們就拉住保羅，把他帶到亞略巴古，說，你所講的這新教訓是什麼，我們可以知道麼？<br>And they took hold of him and led him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is which is being spoken by you? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>17:20</a></td><td class=td>因為你有些奇怪的事，傳到我們耳中，我們願意知道這些事是什麼意思。<br>For you are bringing strange things to our ears. We intend to know therefore what these things mean. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>17:21</a></td><td class=td>（所有的雅典人和住在那裏的客旅，都沒有閑暇顧別的事，隻將較新的事說說聽聽。）<br>(Now all the Athenians and the foreigners sojourning there spent their time on nothing other than telling or hearing something new.) </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>17:22</a></td><td class=td>保羅站在亞略巴古當中，說，諸位，雅典人哪，我看你們凡事都很敬畏鬼神。<br>And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, Men of Athens, I observe that in every way you very much revere your deities. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>17:23</a></td><td class=td>我經過各處的時候，仔細觀看你們所敬拜的，遇見一座壇，上麵寫著：給未識之神。你們所不認識而敬拜的，我現在傳給你們。<br>For while I was passing through and carefully observing the objects of your worship, I even found an altar on which was inscribed, To An UNKNOWN God. What therefore you worship without knowing, this I announce to you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>17:24</a></td><td class=td>創造宇宙和其中萬物的神，既是天地的主，就不住人手所造的殿，<br>The God who made the world and all things in it, this One, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>17:25</a></td><td class=td>也不用人手服事，好像缺少什麼，自己倒將生命、氣息、萬物賜給萬人。<br>Neither is He served by human hands as though He needed anything in addition, since He Himself gives to all life and breath and all things. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>17:26</a></td><td class=td>祂從一本造出萬族的人，住在全地麵上，並且預先定準他們的時期，和居住的疆界，<br>And He made from one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, determining beforehand their appointed seasons and the boundaries of their dwelling, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>17:27</a></td><td class=td>要叫他們尋求神，或者可以揣摩而得，其實祂離我們各人不遠；<br>That they might seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, even though He is not far from each one of us; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>17:28</a></td><td class=td>因我們生活、行動、存留都在於祂，就如你們中間有些作詩的說，原來我們也是祂的族類。<br>For in Him we live and move and are, as even some poets among you have said, For we are also His race. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>17:29</a></td><td class=td>我們既是神的族類，就不當以為那神聖的，像人用手藝、心思所雕刻的金、銀、石頭一樣。<br>Being then the race of God, we ought not to suppose that what is divine is like gold or silver or stone, like an engraving of art and thought of man. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>17:30</a></td><td class=td>世人蒙昧無知的時候，神並不鑒察，如今卻吩咐各處的人都要悔改，<br>Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, God now charges all men everywhere to repent, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>17:31</a></td><td class=td>因為祂已經定了日子，要藉著祂所設立的人，按公義審判天下；祂已叫這人從死人中複活，供萬人作可信的憑據。<br>Because He has set a day in which He is to judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has designated, having furnished proof to all by raising Him from the dead. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>17:32</a></td><td class=td>眾人聽見死人複活，就有譏誚他的，又有人說，我們還要再聽你講這個。<br>And when they heard of a resurrection of the dead, some scoffed; and others said, We will hear you yet again concerning this. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>17:33</a></td><td class=td>這樣，保羅便從他們當中出去了。<br>Thus Paul went out from their midst. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>17:34</a></td><td class=td>但有幾個人貼近他，並且信了，其中有亞略巴古的官丟尼修，和一個名叫大馬哩的婦人，還有其他同著他們的人。<br>But some men joined him and believed, among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
