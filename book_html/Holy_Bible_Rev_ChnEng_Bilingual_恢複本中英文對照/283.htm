<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>16:1</a></td><td class=td>大衛剛過山頂，見米非波設的仆人洗巴拉著備好了的兩匹驢，驢上馱著二百個餅，一百串葡萄幹，一百個夏天的果品，一皮袋酒來迎接他。<br>And when David was a little past the summit, Ziba, Mephibosheth's attendant,  came to meet him with a pair of saddled asses and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and a hundred clusters of raisins and a hundred summer fruit and a skin of wine.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>16:2</a></td><td class=td>王問洗巴說，你帶這些來是什麼意思？洗巴說，驢是給王的家眷騎的，餅和夏天的果品是給少年人吃的，酒是給在曠野疲乏的人喝的。<br>And the king said to Ziba, Why do you have these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on, and the bread and the summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for those who faint in the wilderness to drink.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>16:3</a></td><td class=td>王問說，你主人的兒子在那裏？洗巴對王說，他還留在耶路撒冷，因他說，以色列家今日必將我父親的國歸還我。<br>And the king said, And where is your master's son? And Ziba said to the king, He is now dwelling in Jerusalem, for he said, Today the house of Israel will restore to me the kingdom of my father.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>16:4</a></td><td class=td>王對洗巴說，看哪，凡屬米非波設的都歸你了。洗巴說，我向你叩拜。我主我王阿，願我在你眼前蒙恩。<br>And the king said to Ziba, Now all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours. And Ziba said, I bow myself  to  you. May I find favor in your sight, O my lord the king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>16:5</a></td><td class=td>大衛王到了巴戶琳，見有一個人從那裏出來，是掃羅家族基拉的兒子，名叫示每；他出來時，一麵走一麵咒罵，<br>And when King David came to Bahurim, a man of the family of the house of Saul came forth from there, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came forth, cursing as he came forth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>16:6</a></td><td class=td>又拿石頭打大衛王和王的眾臣仆；眾民和眾勇士都在王的左右。<br>And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right and on his left.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>16:7</a></td><td class=td>示每咒罵的時候這樣說，你這流人血的卑劣之徒，去罷，去罷。<br>And Shimei spoke thus in his cursing, Go away, go away, you man of bloodshed and worthless fellow.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>16:8</a></td><td class=td>你流掃羅家的血，接續他作王；耶和華把流這一切血的罪報應在你身上，又將國交在你兒子押沙龍手中；現在你自取其禍，因為你是流人血的人。<br>Jehovah has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and Jehovah has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son; and now you  have been taken in your own mischief, for you are a man of bloodshed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>16:9</a></td><td class=td>洗魯雅的兒子亞比篩對王說，這死狗怎可咒罵我主我王呢？求你容我過去，取下他的頭來。<br>Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>16:10</a></td><td class=td>王說，洗魯雅的兒子，我與你們何幹？他咒罵，若是因耶和華告訴他要咒罵大衛，如此，誰敢說你為什麼這樣行呢？<br>But the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he curses, and if Jehovah has told him to curse David, who then can say, Why have you done so?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>16:11</a></td><td class=td>大衛又對亞比篩和眾臣仆說，我親生的兒子尚且尋索我的性命，何況這便雅憫人呢？由他咒罵罷，因為這是耶和華告訴他的。<br>And David said to Abishai and all his servants, Now my son, who came forth from my body, seeks my life; how much more then this Benjaminite will do so. Leave him alone and let him curse, for Jehovah has told him  to do so.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>16:12</a></td><td class=td>或者耶和華見我遭難，為了今日這人對我的咒罵，就以好處回報我。<br>It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done to me and that Jehovah will repay me with good for his cursing on this day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>16:13</a></td><td class=td>於是大衛和跟隨他的人往前行路。示每沿著山邊，與大衛並行，一麵行走一麵咒罵，又拿石頭打他，拿塵土揚他。<br>And David and his men went on their way. And Shimei went along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went; and he threw stones at him and cast dust  upon him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>16:14</a></td><td class=td>王和跟隨他的眾人疲疲乏乏的到了一個地方，就在那裏歇息歇息。<br>And the king and all the people who were with him arrived weary, and he refreshed himself there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>16:15</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍和以色列眾百姓來到耶路撒冷；亞希多弗也與他同來。<br>Meanwhile Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem; and Ahithophel was with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>16:16</a></td><td class=td>大衛的朋友亞基人戶篩來見押沙龍，對他說，願王萬歲！願王萬歲！<br>And when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, Long live the king! Long live the king!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>16:17</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍對戶篩說，這是你以恩慈待朋友麼？為什麼不與你的朋友同去呢？<br>And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>16:18</a></td><td class=td>戶篩對押沙龍說，不然，耶和華和這民，並以色列眾人所揀選的，我必歸順他，與他同住。<br>And Hushai said to Absalom, No; but the one whom Jehovah and this people and all the men of Israel choose, his will I be, and with him will I dwell.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>16:19</a></td><td class=td>再者，我當服事誰呢？豈不應當在前王的兒子麵前服事麼？我怎樣在你父親麵前服事，也必照樣在你麵前服事。<br>Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should it not be in the presence of his son? As I served in the presence of your father, so will I be in your presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>16:20</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍對亞希多弗說，你們定個計謀，我們怎樣行才好。<br>Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your counsel as to what we should do.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>16:21</a></td><td class=td>亞希多弗對押沙龍說，你父親所留下看守宮殿的妃嬪，你可以與她們親近。全以色列聽見你已使你父親憎惡你，凡與你在一起的人，手就更堅強了。<br>And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in unto your father's concubines whom he left to keep the house, and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself abhorrent to your father; then the hands of all those who are with you will be strong.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>16:22</a></td><td class=td>於是人為押沙龍在宮殿的平頂上支搭帳棚；押沙龍在以色列眾人眼前，與他父親的妃嬪親近。<br>So they spread a tent for Absalom upon the roof, and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>16:23</a></td><td class=td>那些日子亞希多弗所定的計謀，好像人問神的話一樣；他無論給大衛，或給押沙龍所定的計謀，都是這樣。<br>Now the counsel of Ahithophel that he gave in those days was as if one inquired of the oracle of God; all the counsel of Ahithophel was thus, both with David and with Absalom.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
