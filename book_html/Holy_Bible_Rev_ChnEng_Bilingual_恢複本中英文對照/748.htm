<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>3:1</a></td><td class=td>有話說，人若休妻，妻子離他而去，作了別人的妻子，前夫豈能再回到她那裏麼？若回到她那裏，那地豈不是大大汙穢了麼？但你和許多所愛的人行邪淫，還可以歸向我；這是耶和華說的。<br>It is said, If a man divorces his wife And she goes from him And becomes another man's wife, Will he return to her again? Will not that land be Utterly polluted? But you have committed fornication with many lovers. et return to Me, declares  Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>3:2</a></td><td class=td>你向光禿的高處舉目觀看：你在何處沒有被玷汙？你坐在道旁等候他們，好像亞拉伯人在荒野埋伏一樣；你以你的淫行邪惡汙穢了這地。<br>Lift up your eyes to the bare heights and see: Where have you not been ravished? By the roads you sat for them, Like an Arab in the desert; And you have polluted the land With your fornication and your wickedness.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>3:4</a></td><td class=td>你豈不是剛剛向我呼叫說，我父阿，你是我幼年時的引導麼？<br>Have you not just now called out to Me, My Father, You are the guide of my youth?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>3:5</a></td><td class=td>耶和華豈永遠懷怒，存留到底麼？你雖這樣說，還是盡所能的作惡事。<br>Will He preserve His anger forever? Will He keep it perpetually? This you have spoken; yet you have done what evil things That you could.</td></tr>

She went up on every high mountain and under every flourishing tree and committed fornication there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>3:7</a></td><td class=td>我說，她行這一切事以後，必歸向我；她卻不歸向我；她奸詐的妹妹猶大也看見了。<br>And I said, After she has done all these things, she will return to Me; but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>3:8</a></td><td class=td>因背道的以色列所犯的一切奸淫，我給她休書休了她；但她奸詐的妹妹猶大還不懼怕，也去行淫。<br>And I saw that because of all the adultery that Israel the apostate committed I divorced her and gave her a certificate of divorce, yet her sister Judah the treacherous did not fear but went and committed fornication also.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>3:13</a></td><td class=td>隻要承認你的罪孽，就是你違背了耶和華你的神，在各青翠樹下，向外邦神東奔西跑，沒有聽從我的話；這是耶和華說的。<br>Only acknowledge your iniquity, That you have transgressed against Jehovah your God And have turned your ways here and there to strangers under every flourishing tree, And have not listened to My voice, declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>3:14</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，背道的兒女阿，回來罷，因為我是你們的丈夫；並且我必將你們從一城取一人，從一族取兩人，將你們帶到錫安。<br>Return, O apostate children, declares Jehovah, for I am a Husband to you; and I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and will bring you to Zion.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>3:15</a></td><td class=td>我也必將合乎我心的牧者賜給你們；他們必以知識和明智，牧養你們。<br>And I will give you shepherds according to My own heart, who will feed you knowledge and understanding.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>3:16</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，你們在這地繁衍增多，當那些日子，人必不再題說，耶和華的約櫃！他們不追想，不記念，不覺缺少，也不再製造。<br>And when you are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, declares Jehovah, they will no longer say, The Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah! And it will not come to mind, nor will they remember it or visit it; and it will not be made again.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>3:17</a></td><td class=td>那時，人必稱耶路撒冷為耶和華的寶座；萬國必聚集到那裏，因為耶和華的名在耶路撒冷；他們必不再隨從自己頑梗的惡心行事。<br>At that time they will call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah, and all the nations will be gathered to it because the name of Jehovah is at Jerusalem; and they will no longer walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>3:18</a></td><td class=td>當那些日子，猶大家要和以色列家同行，從北方之地，一同來到我賜給他們列祖為業之地。<br>In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north to the land which I have given to their fathers as an inheritance.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>3:19</a></td><td class=td>我說，我多麼願意將你安置在眾子之中，賜給你可悅之地，就是萬國中極佳美的產業！我又說，你們必稱我為父，也不再轉去不跟從我。<br>But I said, How I will put you among the  sons, And give you a pleasant land, An inheritance of the most ornate of the nations!

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>3:21</a></td><td class=td>在光禿的高處聽見聲音，就是以色列人哭泣懇求之聲；因為他們走了彎曲的道路，忘記了耶和華他們的神。<br>A voice is heard on the bare heights, The weeping, the supplications, of the children of Israel; For they have perverted their way; They have forgotten Jehovah their God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>3:22</a></td><td class=td>背道的兒女阿，回來罷；我要醫治你們背道的病。我們來到你這裏，因你是耶和華我們的神。<br>Return, O apostate children; I will heal you of your apostasies. Now we come to You, For You are Jehovah our God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>3:23</a></td><td class=td>仰望從小山，或從大山的喧嚷中得幫助，真是枉然。以色列得拯救，誠然在於耶和華我們的神。<br>Surely in vain have we hoped for anything from the hills; The mountains are a tumult; Surely in Jehovah our God Is the salvation of Israel.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>3:25</a></td><td class=td>我們在自己的羞恥中躺臥罷；願慚愧將我們遮蓋；因為我們和我們的列祖，從幼年直到今日，常常得罪耶和華我們的神，沒有聽從耶和華我們神的話。<br>Let us lie down in our shame, and let our humiliation cover us; for we have sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, since our youth even unto this day; and we have not listened to the voice of Jehovah our God.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
