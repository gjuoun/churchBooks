<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>20:1</a></td><td class=td>大衛從拉瑪的拿約逃跑，來到約拿單麵前，說，我作了什麼？我有什麼罪孽，在你父親麵前犯了什麼罪，他竟尋索我的性命呢？<br>Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said to Jonathan, What have I done? What is my iniquity, or what is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>20:2</a></td><td class=td>約拿單對他說，斷然不是！你絕不至於死。我父親作事，無論大小，沒有不叫我知道的。怎麼獨有這事隱瞞我呢？事情絕不會如此。<br>And he said to him, Far from it! You shall not die. My father does nothing great or small that he does not disclose to me. So why should my father hide this matter from me? Such would not happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>20:3</a></td><td class=td>大衛又起誓說，你父親準知我在你眼前蒙恩；所以他心裏說，不如不叫約拿單知道這事，恐怕他愁煩。但我確實指著永活的耶和華起誓，又指著你的性命起誓，我離死不過一步。<br>Then David swore again and said, Your father fully knows that I have found favor in your sight; so he says, Do not let Jonathan know about this; otherwise, he will be grieved. But truly as Jehovah lives and as your soul lives, there is  but a step between me and death.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>20:4</a></td><td class=td>約拿單對大衛說，凡你心裏所求的，我必為你成就。<br>And Jonathan said to David, Whatever you say, I will do for you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>20:5</a></td><td class=td>大衛對約拿單說，明日是初一，我當與王同席，求你讓我去藏在田野，直到後天晚上。<br>And David said to Jonathan, It is the new moon tomorrow, and I am to sit with the king at the meal. But let me go, and I will hide myself in the field until the following evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>20:6</a></td><td class=td>你父親若察覺我不在，你就說，大衛切求我許他趕回自己的城伯利恒去，因為他全家在那裏獻年祭。<br>If your father misses me at all, you shall say, David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city, for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>20:7</a></td><td class=td>你父親若這樣說，好；你仆人就平安了。他若大大發怒，你就知道他決意要害我。<br>If he says in this way, Fine;  then your servant will have peace. But if he becomes angry at all, know that evil has been determined by him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>20:8</a></td><td class=td>求你以恩慈待你仆人，因你已經帶你仆人在耶和華麵前與你結盟。我若有罪孽，不如你自己殺我，何必將我帶到你父親那裏呢？<br>Deal kindly then with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of Jehovah with you. But if there is any iniquity in me, you kill me. Why then should you bring me to your father?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>20:9</a></td><td class=td>約拿單說，這事絕不至臨到你！我若知道我父親決意害你，我豈不告訴你麼？<br>And Jonathan said, Far be it from you! For if I knew at all that evil has been determined by my father to come upon you, would I not tell it to you?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>20:10</a></td><td class=td>大衛對約拿單說，你父親若用嚴厲的話回答你，誰來告訴我呢？<br>Then David said to Jonathan, Who will tell me whether or not your father has responded to you harshly?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>20:11</a></td><td class=td>約拿單對大衛說，來，我們往田野去罷。二人就往田野去了。<br>And Jonathan said to David, Come and let us go out into the field. And they both went out into the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>20:12</a></td><td class=td>約拿單對大衛說，願耶和華以色列的神為證。明日約在這時候，或後天，我探我父親的意思，若向你有好意，我就必打發人告訴你。<br>And Jonathan said to David, By Jehovah, the God of Israel: When I search out my father about this time tomorrow,  or on the following day, and if he is good toward David, I will surely send  word to you and disclose  it to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>20:13</a></td><td class=td>我父親若有意害你，我不告訴你使你平平安安的走，願耶和華重重的降罰與我。願耶和華與你同在，如同從前與我父親同在一樣。<br>May Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and even more, if it pleases my father to do you evil, and I do not disclose  it to you and send you away to go in peace. And may Jehovah be with you as He was with my father.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>20:14</a></td><td class=td>我活著的時候，你要以耶和華的慈愛待我，免我死亡；<br>And while I am still alive, do show me the lovingkindness of Jehovah, that I may not die;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>20:15</a></td><td class=td>就是我死後，耶和華從地上剪除你每一個仇敵的時候，你也永不可向我家絕了慈愛。<br>And never cut off your lovingkindness from my house, not even when Jehovah has cut off David's enemies to the man from the face of the earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>20:16</a></td><td class=td>於是約拿單與大衛家結盟，說，願耶和華藉大衛仇敵的手追討背約的罪。<br>So Jonathan made  a covenant with the house of David,  saying, And Jehovah will require  it at the hand of David's enemies.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>20:17</a></td><td class=td>約拿單因著對大衛的愛，就使大衛再起誓，因他愛大衛如同愛自己的性命。<br>And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him, for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>20:18</a></td><td class=td>約拿單對他說，明日是初一，你的座位空著，人必察覺你不在。<br>Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon; and you will be missed, for your seat will be empty.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>20:19</a></td><td class=td>你等三日，就要速速下去，到你從前遇事藏身的地方，留在以色石頭那裏。<br>And when you have waited three days, you shall go far down and come to the place where you hid yourself while  all this was happening; and you shall remain at the stone Ezel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>20:20</a></td><td class=td>我要向石頭旁邊射三箭，如同射箭靶一樣。<br>And I will shoot three arrows to its side, as though I were shooting at a mark.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>20:21</a></td><td class=td>我要打發僮仆，說，去把箭找來。我若對僮仆說，看哪，箭在你後頭，把箭拿來；你就可以回來；我指著永活的耶和華起誓，你必平安無事。<br>And just then I will send a boy,  saying, Go; find the arrows. If I say to the boy, The arrows are there to this side of you; gather them; then come, for you have peace and there is no problem, as Jehovah lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>20:22</a></td><td class=td>我若這樣對童子說，看哪，箭在你前頭；你就要去，因為是耶和華打發你去的。<br>But if I speak in this way to the young man, The arrows are there beyond you; then go, for Jehovah has sent you away.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>20:23</a></td><td class=td>至於你我今日所說的話，有耶和華在你我中間為證，直到永遠。<br>And concerning this matter that I and you have spoken of, it is Jehovah who is between me and you forever.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>20:24</a></td><td class=td>大衛就去藏在田野。到了初一日，王坐席要吃飯。<br>So David hid himself in the field. And when the new moon came, the king sat at the meal to eat.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>20:25</a></td><td class=td>王照常坐在他的座位，就是靠牆的座位上，約拿單起身而立，押尼珥坐在掃羅旁邊，大衛的席位空著。<br>And the king sat on his seat as at other times, on his seat near the wall; and Jonathan rose up, and Abner sat down beside Saul, but David's place was empty.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>20:26</a></td><td class=td>然而那日掃羅沒有說什麼，他想大衛遇事以致不潔，他必定是不潔。<br>But Saul said nothing that day  about it, for he thought, Something has happened  to him; he is not clean; surely  he is not clean.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>20:27</a></td><td class=td>次日，就是初二日，大衛的席位還空著。掃羅對他兒子約拿單說，耶西的兒子為何昨日、今日都沒有來吃飯？<br>And on the day after the new moon, the second day, David's place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has the son of Jesse come neither yesterday nor today to the meal?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>20:28</a></td><td class=td>約拿單回答掃羅說，大衛切求我許他往伯利恒去。<br>And Jonathan answered Saul, David asked leave of me earnestly  to go to Bethlehem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>20:29</a></td><td class=td>他說，求你讓我去，因為我們家族在那城裏有獻祭的事；我兄長吩咐我去。如今我若在你眼前蒙恩，求你讓我脫身去見我的弟兄；所以大衛沒有赴王的席。<br>And he said, Let me go, I beg you; for our family has a sacrifice in that city, and my brother commanded me  to be there. So now if I have found favor in your sight, let me slip away to see my brothers. Therefore he has not come to the king's table.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>20:30</a></td><td class=td>掃羅向約拿單發怒，對他說，你這邪僻悖逆之婦人的兒子！我豈不知道你選擇耶西的兒子，自取羞辱，並且使你母親露體蒙羞麼？<br>And Saul's anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>20:31</a></td><td class=td>耶西的兒子若在地上活著，你和你的國必站立不住。現在你要打發人去，將他捉拿交給我；他是該死的。<br>For as long as the son of Jesse is alive on the earth, you and your kingdom will not be established. Now therefore send  someone and bring him to me, for he is as good as dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>20:32</a></td><td class=td>約拿單回答他父親掃羅說，他為什麼該被處死？他作了什麼呢？<br>And Jonathan answered Saul his father and said to him, Why must he be put to death? What has he done?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>20:33</a></td><td class=td>掃羅向約拿單掄槍要刺他，約拿單就知道他父親決意要殺大衛。<br>But Saul threw his spear at him in order to strike him down. So Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to put David to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>20:34</a></td><td class=td>於是約拿單氣忿忿的從席上起來，在這初二日沒有吃飯；他因見父親羞辱大衛，就為大衛愁煩。<br>And Jonathan rose up from the table in burning anger and did not eat any food on the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved about David because his father had shamed him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>20:35</a></td><td class=td>到了次日早晨，約拿單按著與大衛約定的時候出到田野，有一個小僮仆跟著他。<br>Then in the morning Jonathan went forth to the field for the appointment with David, and a small boy was with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>20:36</a></td><td class=td>約拿單對僮仆說，你跑去，把我所射的箭找來。僮仆跑去，約拿單就把箭射在僮仆前頭。<br>And he said to his boy, Run  and find the arrows that I am shooting. While the boy was running, he shot the arrow beyond him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>20:37</a></td><td class=td>僮仆到了約拿單落箭之地，約拿單在僮仆後麵呼叫說，箭不是在你前頭麼？<br>And when the boy came to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called out after the boy and said, The arrow is there beyond you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>20:38</a></td><td class=td>約拿單又在僮仆後麵呼叫說，速速的去，不要停留。約拿單的僮仆就把箭拾起，來到主人那裏。<br>And Jonathan called out to the boy, Hurry up quickly; do not stay there. And Jonathan's boy gathered the arrows and came to his master.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>20:39</a></td><td class=td>僮仆一點也不知道這是什麼意思，隻有約拿單和大衛知道。<br>And the boy knew nothing; only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=41>20:41</a></td><td class=td>僮仆一去，大衛就從那石頭南邊藏身之處出來，麵伏於地，拜了三拜；二人彼此親嘴，相對哭泣，大衛哭得更慟。<br>And when the boy went, David rose up from  his hiding place toward the south and fell on his face to the ground; and he bowed himself three times.
