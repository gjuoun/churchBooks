<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>7:1</a></td><td class=td>所以親愛的，我們既有這些應許，就當潔淨自己，除去肉身和靈一切的玷汙，敬畏神，以成全聖別。<br>Therefore since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>7:2</a></td><td class=td>你們要容納我們，我們未曾虧負誰，未曾敗壞誰，未曾占誰的便宜。<br>Make room for us; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>7:3</a></td><td class=td>我說這話，不是為定罪你們，因我先前說過，你們是在我們的心裏，以至同死同活。<br>I do not say this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts for our dying together and our living together. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>7:4</a></td><td class=td>我向你們大大的放膽，我為你們多多的誇口；我滿得安慰，在我們一切的患難中，我格外的洋溢喜樂。<br>Great is my boldness toward you, great is my boasting on your behalf; I am filled with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our affliction. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>7:5</a></td><td class=td>原來我們就是到了馬其頓，我們的肉身也不得安寧，反而凡事遭患難，外有爭戰，內有懼怕。<br>For even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted in everything; without were fightings, within were fears. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>7:6</a></td><td class=td>但那安慰頹喪之人的神，藉著提多來，安慰了我們；<br>But He who comforts those who are downcast, that is, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>7:7</a></td><td class=td>不但藉著他來，也藉著他在你們身上所得的安慰，安慰了我們，因他把你們的切望、你們的哀慟、和你們為我的熱心，都告訴了我們，叫我更加喜樂。<br>And not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted because of you, declaring to us your longing, your lamentation, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>7:8</a></td><td class=td>我雖曾寫信叫你們憂愁，我並不懊悔；雖然我曾懊悔過，（因我曉得那信曾叫你們憂愁，盡管是一時的，）<br>For though I caused you sorrow by the letter, I do not regret it. Even if I did regret it (for I see that that letter, even if for an hour, caused you sorrow), </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>7:9</a></td><td class=td>如今我卻喜樂，不是因你們憂愁，乃是因你們憂愁以致悔改，因為你們照著神憂愁，就不至於在任何事上，因我們受虧損了。<br>Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to God, that in nothing you might suffer loss from us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>7:10</a></td><td class=td>因為照著神憂愁，生出悔改以致得救，是沒有後悔的，但世上的憂愁是產生死亡。<br>For sorrow according to God works repentance unto salvation, which is without regret; but the sorrow of the world works out death. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>7:11</a></td><td class=td>且看這事，你們照著神憂愁，在你們中間已產生何等的熱誠、甚而自訴、甚而憤恨、甚而懼怕、甚而切望、甚而熱心、甚而責罰。在各方麵，你們都證薦自己在那件事上是純潔的。<br>For behold this very thing, your being made sorrowful according to God, what earnestness it has worked out in you, indeed what defense, indeed what indignation, indeed what fear, indeed what longing, indeed what zeal, indeed what punishment! In everything you have commended yourselves to be pure in the matter. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>7:12</a></td><td class=td>因此，我雖曾寫信給你們，卻不是為那虧負人的，也不是為那受虧負的，乃是為要在神麵前，向你們顯明你們對我們的熱誠。<br>So then, though I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of him who did the wrong, nor for the sake of him who was wronged, but for the sake of manifesting to you before God your earnestness for us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>7:13</a></td><td class=td>所以我們得了安慰，並且在這安慰之外，我們因提多的喜樂，就越發更加喜樂，因他的靈從你們眾人得了暢快。<br>Because of this we have been comforted. And in addition to our comfort, we rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>7:14</a></td><td class=td>因為我若對提多誇獎了你們什麼，也不覺得羞愧。相反的，我們對你們所說的一切事，怎樣是真實的，我們在提多麵前所誇獎你們的，也怎樣成了真實的。<br>For if in anything I boasted to him on your behalf, I have not been put to shame; on the contrary, as we spoke all things in truth to you, so also our boasting before Titus turned out to be the truth. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>7:15</a></td><td class=td>並且提多想起你們眾人的順從，就是怎樣恐懼戰兢的接待他，他的心腸就越發傾向你們了。<br>And his affections are abundantly toward you, he remembering the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>7:16</a></td><td class=td>我如今喜樂，能在凡事上為你們放心。<br>I rejoice that in everything I have boldness because of you. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
