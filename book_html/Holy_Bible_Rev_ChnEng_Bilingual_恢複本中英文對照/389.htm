<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>22:1</a></td><td class=td>耶路撒冷的居民立約蘭的小兒子亞哈謝接續他作王，因為隨同亞拉伯人上來攻營的一隊軍兵，曾殺了亞哈謝的眾兄長；因此，猶大王約蘭的兒子亞哈謝作了王。<br>And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, for the band of men who had come up to the camp with the Arabians had slain all the older sons; so Ahaziah the son of Jehoram the king of Judah reigned.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>22:2</a></td><td class=td>亞哈謝登基的時候年二十二歲，在耶路撒冷作王一年；他母親名叫亞他利雅，是暗利的孫女。<br>Ahaziah was  twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>22:3</a></td><td class=td>亞哈謝也行亞哈家所行的道路，因為他母親給他主謀，使他行惡。<br>He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor in acting wickedly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>22:4</a></td><td class=td>他行耶和華眼中看為惡的事，像亞哈家一樣；因他父親死後有亞哈家的人給他主謀，使他敗壞。<br>And he did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah, like the house of Ahab; for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his own destruction.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>22:5</a></td><td class=td>他照亞哈家的計謀而行，同以色列王亞哈的兒子約蘭往基列的拉末去，與亞蘭王哈薛爭戰。亞蘭人打傷了約蘭，<br>He walked also in their counsel and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab the king of Israel to battle against Hazael the king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead. And the Syrians struck Joram,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>22:6</a></td><td class=td>約蘭回到耶斯列，醫治在拉末與亞蘭王哈薛打仗所受的傷。猶大王約蘭的兒子亞哈謝因為亞哈的兒子約蘭病了，就下到耶斯列看望他。<br>And he returned to heal in Jezreel because of the wounds that they had inflicted on him in Ramah when he fought with Hazael the king of Syria. And  Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, for he was sick.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>22:7</a></td><td class=td>亞哈謝去見約蘭就被害了，這是出於神；因為他到了，就同約蘭出去攻擊寧示的孫子耶戶，這耶戶是耶和華所膏，使他剪除亞哈家的。<br>Now the downfall of Ahaziah was of God, because he went to Joram. And when he arrived, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>22:8</a></td><td class=td>耶戶討亞哈家罪的時候，遇見猶大的眾首領和亞哈謝的眾侄子服事亞哈謝，就把他們都殺了。<br>And when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the captains of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brothers serving Ahaziah; and he slew them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>22:9</a></td><td class=td>哈謝藏在撒瑪利亞，耶戶尋找他，眾人將他拿住，送到耶戶那裏，就殺了他，將他葬埋；因他們說，他是那全心尋求耶和華之約沙法的兒子。這樣，亞哈謝的家無力保守國權。<br>And he sought for Ahaziah, and they caught him; for he had been hiding in Samaria. And they brought him to Jehu and killed him. And they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who pursued Jehovah with all his heart. And the house of Ahaziah did not have the strength to retain the kingdom.</td></tr>
