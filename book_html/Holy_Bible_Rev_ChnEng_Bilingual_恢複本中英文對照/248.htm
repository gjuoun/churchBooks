<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>12:2</a></td><td class=td>現在有這王在你們前麵行。我已年老發白，我的兒子都在你們這裏；我從幼年直到今日，都在你們前麵行。<br>And now, here is the king who goes before you. But I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you, and I have gone before you from my youth until this day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>12:3</a></td><td class=td>我在這裏，你們隻管在耶和華麵前，並在祂的受膏者麵前，作見證指控我。我奪過誰的牛，搶過誰的驢，欺壓過誰，虐待過誰，從誰手裏受過賄賂因而眼瞎？若有，我必償還。<br>Here I am; testify against me before Jehovah and before His anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe in order to blind my eyes with it? Then I will restore  it to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>12:4</a></td><td class=td>眾人說，你未曾欺壓我們，虐待我們，也未曾從誰手裏拿過什麼。<br>And they said, You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from anyone's hand.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>12:11</a></td><td class=td>耶和華就差遣耶路巴力、比但、耶弗他、撒母耳；祂救你們脫離四圍仇敵的手，你們才安然居住。<br>And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and He delivered you from the hand of your enemies all around; and you dwelt securely.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>12:12</a></td><td class=td>你們見亞捫人的王拿轄來攻擊你們，就對我說，不然，總要有一位王管轄我們；其實耶和華你們的神是你們的王。<br>And when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, No; but a king will reign over us, though Jehovah your God was your King.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>12:16</a></td><td class=td>現在你們要站住，看耶和華在你們眼前要行的這件大事。<br>Now therefore stand here and see this great thing that Jehovah will do before your eyes.</td></tr>

I will call to Jehovah, that He send thunder and rain; and you will know and see that your wickedness which you have done in the sight of Jehovah by asking for a king for yourselves is great.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>12:19</a></td><td class=td>眾民對撒母耳說，求你為仆人們禱告耶和華你的神，免得我們死亡，因為我們為自己求立王的事，是在我們一切的罪上又加了一件惡事。<br>Then all the people said to Samuel, Pray to Jehovah your God for your servants that we would not die, for we have added to all our sins the evil of asking for a king for ourselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>12:20</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳對百姓說，不要懼怕。你們雖然行了這一切的惡，卻不要偏離不跟從耶和華，隻要全心事奉祂。<br>And Samuel said to the people, Do not be afraid. You have done all this evil, yet do not turn away from following Jehovah, but serve Jehovah with all your heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>12:21</a></td><td class=td>不要偏離耶和華，因為你們若偏離祂，就會隨從那無益且不能施拯救的虛空偶像，它們本是虛空的。<br>And do not turn away, for  your turning away would be after vain  idols, which cannot profit or deliver  you, for they are vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>12:22</a></td><td class=td>耶和華既喜悅把你們作成祂的子民，就必因祂的大名不撇棄祂的子民。<br>For because of His great name Jehovah will not forsake His people, for Jehovah has been pleased to make you a people for Himself.</td></tr>
