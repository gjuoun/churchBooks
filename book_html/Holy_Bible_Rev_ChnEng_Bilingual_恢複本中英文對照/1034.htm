<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>16:3</a></td><td class=td>保羅有意要他一同出去，隻因那些地方的猶太人，就帶他去，給他行了割禮，因為他們都知道他父親是希利尼人。<br>Paul wanted this one to go forth with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>16:4</a></td><td class=td>他們經過各城，把耶路撒冷的使徒和長老所定的規條，交給門徒遵守。<br>And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>16:13</a></td><td class=td>當安息日，我們走出城門，到了河邊，以為那裏是個禱告的地方，我們就坐下對那聚集的婦女講論。<br>And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river, where we supposed there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>16:14</a></td><td class=td>有一個賣紫色布疋的婦人，名叫呂底亞，是推雅推喇城的人，素來敬拜神；她一直聽著，主就開啟她的心，叫她留意保羅所講的。<br>And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple-dyed goods from the city of Thyatira who worshipped God, was listening, whose heart the Lord opened to give heed to the things being spoken by Paul. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>16:15</a></td><td class=td>她和她一家既受了浸，便求我們說，你們若斷定我對主是忠信的，就請到我家裏來住；於是強留我們。<br>And when she was baptized, as well as her household, she entreated us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide. And she constrained us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>16:16</a></td><td class=td>後來，我們往那禱告的地方去，有一個使女迎麵而來，她有巫覡的靈附著，行占卜，叫她的主人們大得財利。<br>And as we were going to the place of prayer, a certain slave girl having a spirit of Python met us, who brought her masters much profit by divining. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>16:17</a></td><td class=td>她跟隨保羅和我們，喊著說，這些人是至高神的奴仆，向你們宣傳救人的道路。<br>This woman followed after Paul and us and cried out, saying, These men are slaves of the Most High God, who announce to you a way of salvation. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>16:18</a></td><td class=td>她一連多日都這樣作，保羅就十分厭煩，轉身對那巫覡的靈說，我在耶穌基督的名裏，吩咐你從她身上出來。那巫覡的靈當時就出來了。<br>And she did this for many days. But Paul was greatly disturbed; and turning, he said to the spirit, I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>16:19</a></td><td class=td>使女的主人們見自己得利的指望沒有了，便揪住保羅和西拉，拉到市場上首領麵前；<br>But when her masters saw that their hope of profit had gone out, they laid hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers. </td></tr>
