<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>6:1</a></td><td class=td>當烏西雅王崩的那年，我看見主坐在高高的寶座上，祂的衣袍垂下，遮滿聖殿。<br>In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the train of His robe filled the temple.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>6:2</a></td><td class=td>其上有撒拉弗侍立，各有六個翅膀：用兩個翅膀遮臉，兩個翅膀遮腳，兩個翅膀飛翔。<br>Seraphim hovered over Him, each having six wings: With two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>6:3</a></td><td class=td>彼此呼喊說，聖哉，聖哉，聖哉，萬軍之耶和華；祂的榮光充滿全地。<br>And one called to the other, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts; The whole earth is filled with His glory.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>6:4</a></td><td class=td>因呼喊者的聲音，門檻的根基震動，殿充滿了煙雲。<br>And the foundations of the threshold shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>6:5</a></td><td class=td>那時我說，禍哉，我滅亡了！因為我是嘴唇不潔的人，又住在嘴唇不潔的民中；又因我眼見大君王萬軍之耶和華。<br>Then I said, Woe is me, for I am finished! For I am a man of unclean lips, And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell; Yet my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>6:6</a></td><td class=td>撒拉弗中有一位飛到我跟前，手裏拿著紅炭，是用火剪從壇上取下來的。<br>Then one of the seraphim flew to me with an ember in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>6:7</a></td><td class=td>他用炭沾我的口，說，看哪，這炭沾了你的嘴唇，你的罪孽便除掉，你的罪就遮蓋了。<br>And he touched my mouth with it and said, Now that this has touched your lips, Your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is purged.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>6:8</a></td><td class=td>我又聽見主的聲音，說，我可以差遣誰呢？誰肯為我們去呢？我說，我在這裏，請差遣我。<br>Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us? And I said, Here am I; send me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>6:9</a></td><td class=td>祂說，你去對這百姓說，你們聽是要聽見，卻絕不領悟；看是要看見，卻絕不曉得。<br>And He said to me, Go and say to this people, Hear indeed, but do not perceive; And see indeed, but do not understand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>6:10</a></td><td class=td>你要使這百姓心蒙脂油，耳朵發沉，眼睛封閉；恐怕他們眼睛看見，耳朵聽見，心裏領悟，回轉過來，便得醫治。<br>Make the heart of this people numb; Dull their ears, And seal their eyes; Lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears, And their heart perceive and return, and they are healed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>6:11</a></td><td class=td>我就說，主阿，這到幾時為止呢？祂說，直到城邑荒廢，無人居住，房屋空閑無人，地土廢棄荒涼；<br>And I said, For how long, Lord? And He said, Until cities lie devastated, Without inhabitants, And houses are without people, And the land is devastated and a waste;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>6:12</a></td><td class=td>並且耶和華將人遷到遠方，在這境內撇棄的地方甚多。<br>And Jehovah has sent men far away from it, And desolate places abound in the midst of the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>6:13</a></td><td class=td>境內若還有十分之一，也必再被摧殘；像栗樹或橡樹，雖被砍伐，樹不卻仍存留；這樹不就是聖別的後裔。<br>But there will still be a tenth part in it; And it in turn is to be burned Like a terebinth or an oak, Whose stump remains after its felling; Its stump will be a holy seed.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
