<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>8:2</a></td><td class=td>還有幾個得醫治，脫離惡靈和疾病的婦女，其中有稱為抹大拉人的馬利亞，曾有七個鬼從她身上趕出來；<br>As well as certain women who were healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>8:3</a></td><td class=td>又有希律的管事苦撒的妻子約亞拿，並蘇撒拿，和好些別的婦女，都是用自己的財物供給耶穌和門徒。<br>And Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many other women, who ministered to them out of their possessions. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>8:4</a></td><td class=td>當大批的群眾聚在一起，又有人從各城絡繹的出去，到耶穌那裏的時候，祂就用比喻說，<br>And while a great crowd was coming together and those from city to city were journeying to Him, He spoke by way of a parable: </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>8:5</a></td><td class=td>那撒種的出去撒他的種子。撒的時候，有的落在路旁，被人踐踏，天空的飛鳥又來吃盡了。<br>The sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some seed fell beside the way, and it was trampled underfoot, and the birds of heaven devoured it. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>8:6</a></td><td class=td>又有別的落在磐石上，生長起來，因為得不著滋潤，就枯幹了。<br>And other seed fell on the rock, and as it grew, it withered because it had no moisture. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>8:7</a></td><td class=td>還有別的落在荊棘裏，荊棘一同生長，就把它擠住了。<br>And other seed fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns grew with it and choked it off. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>8:8</a></td><td class=td>但有別的落在好土裏，生長起來，結實百倍。耶穌說了這些話，就大聲說，有耳可聽的，就應當聽。<br>And other seed fell into the good earth, and when it grew, it produced fruit a hundredfold. When He had said these things, He called out, He who has ears to hear, let him hear. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>8:9</a></td><td class=td>門徒問祂這比喻是什麼意思。<br>And His disciples questioned Him as to what this parable might be. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>8:10</a></td><td class=td>祂說，神國的奧秘，隻給你們知道。但對其餘的人就用比喻，叫他們看卻看不見，聽也不領悟。<br>And He said, To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest they are in parables, in order that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>8:11</a></td><td class=td>這比喻乃是這樣：種子就是神的道。<br>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>8:12</a></td><td class=td>那些在路旁的，就是人聽了道，隨後魔鬼來，從他們心裏把道奪去，恐怕他們信了得救。<br>And those beside the way are those who heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they would not believe and be saved. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>8:14</a></td><td class=td>那落在荊棘裏的，就是人聽了道，走開以後，被今生的思慮、錢財和宴樂全然擠住了，便結不出成熟的子粒來。<br>And that which fell into the thorns, these are those who heard and, going away, are utterly choked by anxieties and riches and pleasures of this life, and do not bring any fruit to maturity. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>8:15</a></td><td class=td>但那落在好土裏的，就是人用美好善良的心聽了道，便持守住，並且忍耐著結實。<br>But that which is in the good earth, these are those who in a noble and good heart hear the word and hold it fast and bear fruit with endurance. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>8:16</a></td><td class=td>沒有人點燈用器皿蓋上，或放在床底下，乃是放在燈台上，叫進來的人看見亮光。<br>Now no one who has lit a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it underneath a bed, but he puts it on a lampstand in order that those who come in may see the light. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>8:17</a></td><td class=td>因為隱藏的事沒有不成為顯明的，隱瞞的事也絕沒有不被人知道而暴露出來的。<br>For nothing is hidden which shall not become manifest, nor concealed which shall not by all means be made known and come into the open. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>8:18</a></td><td class=td>所以你們要留心怎樣聽；因為凡有的，還要加給他；凡沒有的，連他自以為有的，也要從他奪去。<br>Take heed therefore how you hear, for whoever has, it shall be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>8:20</a></td><td class=td>有人報告祂說，你的母親和兄弟站在外麵，想要見你。<br>And it was reported to Him, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside wanting to see You. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>8:21</a></td><td class=td>祂卻回答他們說，這些聽了神的話而實行的人，就是我的母親，我的弟兄了。<br>But He answered and said to them, My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>8:22</a></td><td class=td>有一天，耶穌和門徒上了船，祂對他們說，我們渡到湖的對岸去吧。他們就開了船。<br>And on one of the days He and His disciples got into a boat. And He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched out. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>8:23</a></td><td class=td>正航行的時候，耶穌睡著了。湖上起了風暴，船就要滿了水，甚是危險。<br>And while they were sailing, He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down upon the lake, and they began to fill with water and were in danger. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>8:24</a></td><td class=td>門徒進前來，叫醒了祂，說，夫子，夫子，我們喪命啦！耶穌醒來，斥責風和水上的大浪，風浪就止住，平靜了。<br>And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! And being awakened, He rebuked the wind and the surging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>8:25</a></td><td class=td>耶穌對他們說，你們的信心在那裏？他們既懼怕，又希奇，彼此說，這人到底是誰？祂竟吩咐風和水，連風和水也聽從了祂。<br>And He said to them, Where is your faith? And they became frightened and marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this, that He orders even the winds and the water, and they obey Him? </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>8:27</a></td><td class=td>耶穌一上岸，就有一個鬼附的人，從城裏出來迎著祂。這人已經許久不穿衣服，不住房子，隻住在墳塋間。<br>And when He went out onto the land, a certain man out of the city, who had demons, met Him, and for a considerable time he had not put on clothes and did not remain in a house but among the tombs. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>8:28</a></td><td class=td>他看見耶穌，就喊叫起來，俯伏在祂麵前，大聲說，至高神的兒子耶穌，我與你何幹？求你不要叫我受苦。<br>And when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell before Him and said in a loud voice, What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech You, do not torment me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>8:29</a></td><td class=td>因耶穌曾吩咐汙靈從那人身上出來；原來這鬼屢次抓住他，他常被人看守，又被鐵鏈和腳鐐捆鎖，他竟把鎖鏈掙斷，被鬼催逼到曠野去。<br>For He had charged the unclean spirit to come out from the man; for many times it had seized him and he had been bound with chains and shackles and was kept under watch, yet every time he tore the bonds apart and was driven by the demon into the wilderness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>8:30</a></td><td class=td>耶穌問他說，你名叫什麼？他說，我名叫群，因為有許多鬼進入他裏麵。<br>And Jesus questioned him, What is your name? And he said, Legion, because many demons had entered into him. </td></tr>
