<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>59:1</a></td><td class=td>耶和華的手臂並非縮短不能拯救；祂的耳朵並非發沉不能聽見。<br>No, Jehovah's hand is not so short that it cannot save; Nor is His ear so heavy that it cannot hear.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>59:2</a></td><td class=td>但你們的罪孽使你們與神隔絕，你們的罪使祂掩麵不聽你們。<br>But your iniquities have become a separation Between you and your God, And your sins have hidden His face From you so that He does not hear.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>59:3</a></td><td class=td>因你們的手被血沾染，你們的指頭被罪孽玷汙；你們的嘴唇說虛謊之言，你們的舌頭出不義之語。<br>For your hands are defiled with  blood, And your fingers with iniquity; Your lips have spoken falsehood, Your tongue has muttered  injustice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>59:4</a></td><td class=td>無一人按公義告狀，無一人憑真實辨白；他們都倚靠虛妄，說謊言；所懷的是毒害，所生的是罪孽；<br>No one sues righteously, And no one pleads in truth; They trust in vanity and speak lies; They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>59:5</a></td><td class=td>他們菢毒蛇蛋，結蜘蛛網；人吃這蛋必死；這蛋破裂，必出蝮蛇；<br>They hatch adders' eggs And weave the spider's web; He who eats of their eggs dies, And that which is crushed breaks forth into a viper.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>59:6</a></td><td class=td>他們所結的網不能成為衣服，所作的也不能遮蓋自己；他們的作為都是罪孽的作為，手中所作的都是強暴。<br>Their webs will not become  garments, Nor will they cover themselves with their works; Their works are works of iniquity, And an act of violence is in their palms.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>59:7</a></td><td class=td>他們的腳奔向邪惡，他們急速流無辜人的血；他們的意念都是罪孽的意念；在他們所經過的路上，盡是荒涼和毀壞。<br>Their feet run toward evil, And they hasten to shed innocent blood; Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; Desolation and destruction are in their highways.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>59:8</a></td><td class=td>平安的路，他們不知道；他們的行徑中沒有公平；他們使自己的路徑彎曲；凡行在這路徑上的，都不知道平安。<br>The way of peace they do not know, And there is no justice in their course; They have made their paths crooked; Whoever goes on it does not know peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>59:9</a></td><td class=td>因此公平遠離我們，公義追不上我們；我們指望亮光，卻是黑暗；指望光明，卻行在幽暗中。<br>Therefore justice is far from us, And righteousness does not overtake us; We look eagerly for light, but, ah, darkness, For brightness, but we walk in gloom.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>59:10</a></td><td class=td>我們摸索牆壁，好像瞎子；我們摸索，如同無目之人；我們晌午絆腳，如在黃昏一樣；我們在肥壯人中，就像死人一般。<br>We grope like blind men at the wall; We grope like those without eyes; We stumble at midday as we would at dusk; Among the prospering we are like dead men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>59:11</a></td><td class=td>我們都咆哮如熊，不住哀鳴如鴿子；指望公平，卻沒有公平；指望救恩，救恩卻遠離我們。<br>All of us roar like bears And moan incessantly like doves; We look eagerly for justice, but there is none, For salvation, but it is far from us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>59:12</a></td><td class=td>因為我們的過犯在你麵前增多，我們的罪作證告我們；過犯與我們同在；至於我們的罪孽，我們都知道；<br>For our transgressions are multiplied before You, And our sins respond to You against us; For our transgressions are with us, And as for our iniquities, we know what they are:</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>59:13</a></td><td class=td>就是悖逆不認耶和華，轉去不跟從我們的神；說欺壓和叛逆的話，心懷謊言並且說出。<br>Transgressing and denying Jehovah, And turning away from our God; Speaking oppression and revolt, Conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>59:14</a></td><td class=td>公平轉而退後，公義站在遠處；真實在街上跌倒，正直也不得進入。<br>And justice is turned back, And righteousness stands far off; For truth has stumbled in the street, And uprightness cannot come in.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>59:15</a></td><td class=td>真實少見，離開惡事的人反成掠物。耶和華看見沒有公平，祂眼中以此為惡。<br>And truth is lacking, And he who turns from evil becomes plunder. And Jehovah saw it, and it was evil in His sight That there was no justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>59:16</a></td><td class=td>祂見沒有一人，祂詫異無人代求；就用自己的膀臂施行拯救，以公義扶持自己。<br>And He saw that there was no man, And He was appalled that there was no intercessor. Therefore His arm accomplished salvation for Him, And His righteousness sustained Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>59:17</a></td><td class=td>祂穿上公義如胸甲，頭戴救恩的頭盔，又穿上報仇為衣服，披上熱心如外袍。<br>Thus He put on righteousness as a breastplate, And a helmet of salvation upon His head; And He put on the garments of vengeance for clothing And wrapped Himself with zeal as a mantle.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>59:18</a></td><td class=td>祂必按人的行為施報，將惱怒加給祂的敵人，將報應加給祂的仇敵，向眾海島施行報應。<br>According to their dealings, so will He repay: Wrath to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies; To the coastlands He will repay with recompense.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>59:19</a></td><td class=td>如此，人從日落之處，必敬畏耶和華的名，從日出之地，也必敬畏祂的榮耀；敵人好像河水衝來時，耶和華的靈必高舉旌旗抵擋他。<br>So they will fear the name of Jehovah from the west, And His glory from the rising of the sun; When the adversary comes like a  flood, The Spirit of Jehovah will lift up a standard against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>59:20</a></td><td class=td>必有一位救贖主來到錫安，來到雅各家中轉離過犯的人那裏；這是耶和華說的。<br>And a Redeemer will come to Zion, And unto those who turn from transgression in Jacob, Declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>59:21</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，至於我，我與他們所立的約乃是這樣：我加在你身上的靈，放在你口中的話，必不離你的口，也不離你後裔與你後裔之後裔的口，從今時直到永遠；這是耶和華說的。<br>And as for Me, this is My covenant with them, says Jehovah: My Spirit which is upon you and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your seed, nor from the mouth of your seed's seed, says Jehovah, from now and forever.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
