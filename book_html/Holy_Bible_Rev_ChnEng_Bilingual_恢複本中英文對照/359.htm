<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>21:1</a></td><td class=td>撒但起來攻擊以色列人，激動大衛數算他們。<br>And Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>21:2</a></td><td class=td>大衛對約押和民中的首領說，你們去數點以色列人，從別是巴直到但，將結果帶來給我，我好知道他們的數目。<br>And David said to Joab and to the captains of the people, Go and count Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, and bring the results to me, that I may know their number.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>21:3</a></td><td class=td>約押說，願耶和華使祂的百姓比現在加增百倍。我主我王阿，他們不都是我主的仆人麼？我主為何要求作這事？為何使以色列人陷在罪裏呢？<br>And Joab said, May Jehovah add to His people a hundred times as many as they are. But, O my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? Why does my lord request this? Why should he become a cause of guilt to Israel?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>21:4</a></td><td class=td>但王的話勝過約押。約押就出去，走遍以色列，然後回到耶路撒冷。<br>Nevertheless the king's word prevailed over Joab, and Joab went forth and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>21:5</a></td><td class=td>約押將所數點百姓的數目呈報大衛：全以色列拿刀的有一百一十萬人；猶大拿刀的有四十七萬人。<br>And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. And all Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Judah was four hundred seventy thousand men who drew the sword.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>21:6</a></td><td class=td>惟有利未人和便雅憫人沒有數在其中，因為約押厭惡王的這話。<br>But he did not number Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king's word was abhorrent to Joab.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>21:7</a></td><td class=td>神不喜悅這數點百姓的事，便擊打以色列人。<br>And this matter displeased God, and He struck Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>21:8</a></td><td class=td>大衛對神說，我行這事是犯大罪了；現今求你除掉仆人的罪孽，因我所行的甚是愚昧。<br>And David said to God, I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing; but now put away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>21:9</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對大衛的先見迦得說，<br>And Jehovah spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>21:11</a></td><td class=td>於是迦得來見大衛，對他說，耶和華如此說，你可以自己選取，<br>So Gad went to David and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Take for yourself</td></tr>

And now see what word I should return to Him who sent me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>21:13</a></td><td class=td>大衛對迦得說，我甚為難；我願落在耶和華的手裏，因為祂有豐盛的憐憫；我不願落在人的手裏。<br>And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait; let me fall into the hand of Jehovah, for His compassions are very great; and do not let me fall into the hand of man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>21:14</a></td><td class=td>於是，耶和華降瘟疫於以色列，以色列人就死了七萬。<br>So Jehovah sent a pestilence in Israel, and seventy thousand people of Israel fell.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>21:15</a></td><td class=td>神差遣使者去滅耶路撒冷，剛要滅的時候，耶和華看見，就後悔不降這災；祂對滅城的天使說，彀了，現在住手罷。那時，耶和華的使者站在耶布斯人阿珥楠的禾場附近。<br>And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but as he was destroying it, Jehovah saw and repented of the harm. And He said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now hold back your hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>21:16</a></td><td class=td>大衛舉目，看見耶和華的使者站在天地之間，手裏有拔出來的刀，伸在耶路撒冷以上。大衛和長老都身穿麻衣，麵伏於地。<br>And David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between the earth and the heavens, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, covered with sackcloth, fell on their faces.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>21:17</a></td><td class=td>大衛對神說，吩咐數算百姓的不是我麼？是我犯了罪，行了惡，但這群羊作了什麼呢？耶和華我的神阿，願你的手攻擊我和我的父家，不要攻擊你的民，使他們遭受災疫。<br>And David said to God, Was it not I who ordered the numbering of the people? And it is I who have sinned and acted very wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? O Jehovah my God, let Your hand, I pray, be against me and against the house of my father, but not against Your people that they should be plagued.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>21:18</a></td><td class=td>耶和華的使者吩咐迦得去告訴大衛，叫他上去，在耶布斯人阿珥楠的禾場上為耶和華立一座壇。<br>And the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise up an altar to Jehovah on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>21:19</a></td><td class=td>大衛就照著迦得在耶和華名裏所說的話上去了。<br>And David went up at Gad's word, which he spoke in the name of Jehovah.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>21:22</a></td><td class=td>大衛對阿珥楠說，請你按足價將這禾場的地賣給我，我好在其上為耶和華築一座壇，使百姓受的災疫止住。<br>And David said to Ornan, Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to Jehovah. For the full price you shall give it to me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>21:23</a></td><td class=td>阿珥楠對大衛說，你隻管拿去；我主我王看怎樣好，就怎樣行罷。看哪，我也將牛給你作燔祭，打糧的器具給你當柴燒，麥子給你作素祭。這些我都送給你。<br>And Ornan said to David, Take it; and may my lord the king do whatever seems good in his sight. Look, I have given the oxen for the burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for the wood and the wheat for the meal offering-all this I give.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>21:24</a></td><td class=td>大衛王對阿珥楠說，不然；我必用足價向你買。我不願拿你的物給耶和華，也不願用白得之物獻為燔祭。<br>But King David said to Ornan, No; but I will surely buy it for the full price, for I will not take what is yours for Jehovah and offer up burnt offerings that cost me nothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>21:25</a></td><td class=td>於是大衛為那塊地給了阿珥楠六百舍客勒重的金子。<br>So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the site.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>21:26</a></td><td class=td>大衛在那裏為耶和華築了一座壇，獻燔祭和平安祭。他呼求耶和華，耶和華就應允他，使火從天降在燔祭壇上。<br>And there David built an altar to Jehovah, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And he called on Jehovah, and He answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering.</td></tr>
