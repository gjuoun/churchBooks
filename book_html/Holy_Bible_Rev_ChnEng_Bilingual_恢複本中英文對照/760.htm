<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>15:2</a></td><td class=td>他們問你說，我們往那裏去呢？你便告訴他們，耶和華如此說，定為死亡的必至死亡，定為刀殺的必交刀殺，定為饑荒的必遭饑荒，定為擄掠的必被擄掠。<br>And when they say to you, Where shall we go? Then you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah, Those who are for death to death, And those who are for the sword to the sword, And those who are for famine to famine, And those who are for captivity to captivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>15:3</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，我要以四樣刑罰向他們討罪，就是刀劍殺戮，狗類撕裂，空中的飛鳥和地上的野獸吞吃毀滅。<br>And I will visit them with four kinds of punishment, declares Jehovah: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>15:4</a></td><td class=td>又必使他們在地上萬國中，令人驚恐；都因猶大王希西家的兒子瑪拿西在耶路撒冷所行的事。<br>And I will make them a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>15:6</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，你棄絕了我，轉身退後；因此我伸手攻擊你，毀壞你；我已後悔得不耐煩了。<br>You have forsaken Me, Declares Jehovah. You keep going backward, And I have stretched out My hand against you And have destroyed you; I have become weary of repenting.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>15:7</a></td><td class=td>我在這地各城門口，用簸箕簸散了他們；我使他們喪掉兒女，我毀滅了我的百姓，他們仍不轉離所行的道路。<br>And I have winnowed them with a winnowing fork In the gates of the land; I have bereaved them of children And destroyed My people; They have not turned back from their ways.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>15:8</a></td><td class=td>他們的寡婦在我麵前加增，比海沙更多；我使滅命的午間來到他們那裏，攻擊少年人的母親；我使痛苦驚嚇忽然臨到她身上。<br>Their widows have increased before Me More than the sand of the seas; I have brought to them, Against the mother of the young men, A spoiler at noon; I have caused anguish and terror To fall on her suddenly.</td></tr>

Her sun has gone down while it is still day; She is put to shame and confounded. And the rest of them I will give up to the sword Before their enemies, Declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>15:10</a></td><td class=td>我的母親哪，我有禍了，因你生了我作與遍地相爭相競的人。我素來沒有貸放取利，人也沒有貸放與我，人人卻都咒罵我。<br>Woe is me, my mother, because you bore me, A man of strife and a man of contention to the whole land. I have not lent with interest, Nor have they lent to me; Yet everyone curses me.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>15:15</a></td><td class=td>耶和華阿，你是知道的；求你記念我，眷顧我，向逼迫我的人為我報仇。不要向他們恒久忍耐，以致把我取去；要知道我為你的緣故，擔受了淩辱。<br>O Jehovah, You know; Remember me and visit me, And avenge me of my persecutors. Do not let Your long-suffering for them prevail and have me taken away; Know that for Your sake I bear reproach.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>15:16</a></td><td class=td>耶和華萬軍之神阿，我得著你的言語，就當食物吃了；你的言語成了我心中的歡喜快樂；因我是稱為你名下的人。<br>Your words were found and I ate them, And Your word became to me The gladness and joy of my heart, For I am called by Your name, O Jehovah, God of hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>15:17</a></td><td class=td>我沒有坐在褻慢人的會中，我也沒有歡樂。我因你的手獨自坐著；因你使我滿了憤恨。<br>I did not sit in the assembly of mockers, nor did I exult. Because of Your hand I sat alone, For You have filled me with indignation.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>15:18</a></td><td class=td>我的痛苦，為何長久不止？我的傷痕，為何無法醫治，不能痊愈？難道你待我像詭詐的河，像不可靠的水麼？<br>Why is my pain unceasing, And my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Will You indeed be to me like a deceitful brook? Like waters that fail?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>15:19</a></td><td class=td>耶和華如此說，你若歸回，我就將你帶回，使你站在我麵前；你若將寶貴的從下賤的分別出來，你就可以作我的口；他們必歸向你，你卻不歸向他們。<br>Therefore thus says Jehovah, If you return, I will restore you; You will stand before Me; And if you bring out the precious from the worthless, You will be as My mouth; They will turn to you, But you will not turn to them.</td></tr>
