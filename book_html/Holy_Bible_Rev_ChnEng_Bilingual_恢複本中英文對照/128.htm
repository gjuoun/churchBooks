<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>11:1</a></td><td class=td>百姓因艱苦發怨言，聲音達到耶和華的耳中；耶和華聽見了就怒氣發作，耶和華的火便在他們中間焚燒，燒滅了在營邊界的一些人。<br>And the people became like those who murmur about their misfortune in the ears of Jehovah; and when Jehovah heard it, His anger was kindled, and the fire of Jehovah burned among them and consumed some at the outskirts of the camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>11:2</a></td><td class=td>百姓向摩西哀求，摩西祈求耶和華，火就熄了。<br>And the people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Jehovah, and the fire abated.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>11:3</a></td><td class=td>那地方便名叫他備拉，因為耶和華的火燒在他們中間。　<br>And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah had burned among them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>11:4</a></td><td class=td>他們中間的閑雜人大起貪欲；以色列人又哭號說，誰給我們肉吃呢？<br>And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly; and the children of Israel also wept again and said, Who shall give us meat to eat?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>11:5</a></td><td class=td>我們記得，在埃及的時候不花錢就有魚吃，還有黃瓜、西瓜、韭菜、蔥、蒜。<br>We remember the fish which we used to eat in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>11:6</a></td><td class=td>現在我們的胃口都沒有了，我們眼前除了這嗎哪以外，什麼也沒有。<br>But now our appetite has gone; there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>11:12</a></td><td class=td>這百姓豈是我懷的胎，豈是我生下來的呢？你竟對我說，把他們抱在懷裏，如養育之父抱吃奶的孩子，直抱到你起誓要賜給他們祖宗的地去。<br>Did I conceive all this people? Or did I bring them forth, so that You should say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries the nursing child, to the land which You swore to give to their fathers?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>11:17</a></td><td class=td>我要在那裏降臨，與你說話；我要把你身上的靈，也放在他們身上，他們就要和你同擔這照管百姓的擔子，免得你獨自擔當。<br>Then I will come down and talk with you there, and I will take of the Spirit who is upon you and will put Him upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you do not bear it alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>11:18</a></td><td class=td>又要對百姓說，你們應當將自己分別為聖，豫備明天吃肉，因為你們哭號說，誰給我們肉吃？我們在埃及很好。這聲音達到了耶和華的耳中，所以祂必給你們肉吃。<br>And you shall say to the people, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt. Therefore Jehovah will give you meat, and you shall eat.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>11:19</a></td><td class=td>你們不是吃一天、兩天、五天、十天、二十天，<br>You shall eat not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>11:20</a></td><td class=td>乃是要吃整個月，直到肉從你們鼻孔裏噴出來，使你們厭惡了，因為你們棄絕那在你們中間的耶和華，在祂麵前哭號說，我們為何出了埃及呢？<br>But a whole month, until it comes out from your nostrils, and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, Why did we ever come out of Egypt?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>11:21</a></td><td class=td>但摩西說，這與我同住的百姓，步行的男丁有六十萬，你還說，我要把肉給他們，使他們可以吃整個月。<br>But Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand on foot; and You have said, I will give them meat so that they may eat a whole month.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>11:22</a></td><td class=td>難道為他們宰羊群牛群，就彀他們吃麼？或是為他們聚攏海中所有的魚，就彀他們吃麼？<br>Will flocks and herds be slain for them, to satisfy them? Or will all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to satisfy them?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>11:23</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對摩西說，耶和華的手臂豈是縮短了麼？現在你要看我的話向你應驗不應驗。<br>And Jehovah said to Moses, Has Jehovah's hand become short? Now you will see whether My word will come to pass for you or not.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>11:24</a></td><td class=td>於是摩西出去，將耶和華的話告訴百姓，又招聚百姓的長老中七十個人來，使他們站在會幕的四圍。<br>So Moses went out and told the people the words of Jehovah, and he gathered seventy, each one from the elders of the people, and set them around the tent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>11:25</a></td><td class=td>耶和華在雲中降臨，對摩西說話，並且把他身上的靈，也放在那七十個長老身上。靈停歇在他們身上的時候，他們就申言，以後卻沒有再申言。<br>And Jehovah came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and He took of the Spirit who was upon him, and put Him upon the seventy elders. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did not do so again.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>11:26</a></td><td class=td>但有兩個人仍留在營裏，一個名叫伊利達，一個名叫米達。他們本是在那些登錄的人中，卻沒有到會幕那裏去。靈停歇在他們身上，他們就在營裏申言。<br>But two men had remained in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. (Now they were among those who were registered, but they had not gone out to the tent.) And they prophesied in the camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>11:27</a></td><td class=td>有個少年人跑來告訴摩西說，伊利達和米達在營裏申言。<br>And a certain young man ran and told Moses and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>11:28</a></td><td class=td>摩西的幫手，嫩的兒子約書亞，就是摩西所揀選的一個人，說，請我主摩西禁止他們。<br>And Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, restrain them!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>11:29</a></td><td class=td>摩西對他說，你為我的緣故嫉妒人麼？惟願耶和華的百姓都是申言者，願耶和華把祂的靈放在他們身上！<br>But Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? Oh that all Jehovah's people were prophets, that Jehovah would put His Spirit upon them!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>11:30</a></td><td class=td>於是，摩西和以色列的長老都回到營裏去。<br>And Moses returned to the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>11:31</a></td><td class=td>有風從耶和華那裏刮起，把鵪鶉由海麵刮來，散落在營邊；這邊約有一天的路程，那邊約有一天的路程，布滿營的四圍，離地麵約有二肘。<br>And a wind went forth from Jehovah and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall beside the camp, about a day's journey on this side and a day's journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>11:32</a></td><td class=td>百姓起來，終日終夜，並次日一整天，捕取鵪鶉；至少的也捕取了十賀梅珥，為自己擺在營的四圍。<br>And the people rose up all that day and all the night and all the next day, and they gathered the quail. He who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>11:33</a></td><td class=td>肉在他們牙齒之間尚未嚼爛，耶和華的怒氣就向他們發作，用極重的災殃擊殺了他們。<br>While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah struck the people with a very severe plague.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>11:34</a></td><td class=td>那地方便名叫基博羅哈他瓦，因為他們在那裏葬埋了那些起貪欲的人。<br>And the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>11:35</a></td><td class=td>百姓從基博羅哈他瓦往前行，到了哈洗錄，就住在哈洗錄。<br>From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
