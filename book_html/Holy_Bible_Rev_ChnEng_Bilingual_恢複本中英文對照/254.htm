<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>18:5</a></td><td class=td>掃羅無論差遣大衛往何處，他都前去，並且作事精明。掃羅就立他作戰士長，眾百姓和掃羅的臣仆都看為美。<br>And David went forth; on every  mission that Saul sent him he acted prudently. Therefore Saul set him over the men of battle, and it was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>18:22</a></td><td class=td>掃羅吩咐臣仆說，你們暗中對大衛說，看哪，王喜悅你，王的臣仆也都喜愛你，所以你當作王的女婿。<br>Then Saul commanded his servants, Speak to David privately, saying, See, the king is pleased with you, and all his servants love you. So now become the king's son-in-law.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>18:23</a></td><td class=td>掃羅的臣仆就把這些話說給大衛聽。大衛說，你們以為作王的女婿是輕微的事麼？我是貧窮卑微的人。<br>And Saul's servants spoke these words in David's ears.

For Saul planned to have David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>18:26</a></td><td class=td>掃羅的臣仆將這些話告訴大衛，大衛就歡喜作王的女婿。日期還沒有滿，<br>So when his servants told David these things, David was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. And when the time had not  yet expired,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>18:27</a></td><td class=td>大衛和跟隨他的人起身前往，擊殺了二百非利士人，將他們的陽皮帶來，滿數交給王，為要作王的女婿。於是掃羅將女兒米甲給大衛為妻。<br>David rose up and went, he and his men; and he struck down two hundred Philistine men. And David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.</td></tr>
