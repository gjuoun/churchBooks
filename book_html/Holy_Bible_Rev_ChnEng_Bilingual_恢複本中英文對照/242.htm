<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>6:2</a></td><td class=td>非利士人將祭司和占卜的召了來，問他們說，我們向耶和華的約櫃應當怎樣行？請指示我們用何法將約櫃送回原處。<br>And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, What shall we do with the Ark of Jehovah? Make known to us how we should send it forth to its place.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>6:3</a></td><td class=td>他們說，你們若將以色列神的約櫃送回去，不可空空的送去，必要給祂獻賠罪的禮物，然後你們可以得痊愈，也可以知道祂的手為何不離開你們。<br>And they said, If you send away the Ark of the God of Israel, do not send it away empty, but be sure to return Him a trespass offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be made known to you why His hand has not turned away from you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>6:4</a></td><td class=td>非利士人說，應當用什麼獻為賠罪的禮物呢？他們回答說，當照非利士人首領的數目，用五個金痔瘡，五隻金老鼠，因為在你們眾人和你們首領的身上都是一樣的災。<br>And they said, What is the trespass offering that we should return to Him? And they said, Five golden tumors and five golden mice,  according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was upon you all and upon your lords.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>6:5</a></td><td class=td>所以當製造你們痔瘡的像，和你們那些毀壞地的老鼠的像，並要歸榮耀給以色列的神，或者祂向你們和你們的神，並你們的地，把手放輕些。<br>Therefore you shall make images of your tumors and images of your mice that devastate the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will lighten His hand on you and your gods and your land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>6:6</a></td><td class=td>你們為何硬著心，像埃及人和法老那樣硬著心呢？神嚴厲的對付埃及人，埃及人豈不是讓以色列人去，他們就去了麼？<br>Why then should you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He had dealt severely with them, did they not let the people go, and they went?</td></tr>
