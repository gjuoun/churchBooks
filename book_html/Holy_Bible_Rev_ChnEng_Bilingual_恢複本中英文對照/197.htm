<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>10:2</a></td><td class=td>就甚懼怕；因為基遍是一座大城，如王城一般，比艾城更大，並且城內的人都是勇士。<br>They were very afraid, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai and all its men were mighty men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>10:3</a></td><td class=td>所以耶路撒冷王亞多尼洗德打發人去見希伯侖王何鹹、耶末王毗蘭、拉吉王雅非亞、和伊磯倫王底璧，說，<br>So Adoni-zedek the king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham the king of Hebron and Piram the king of Jarmuth and Japhia the king of Lachish and Debir the king of Eglon, saying,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>10:4</a></td><td class=td>求你們上我這裏來幫助我，我們好攻打基遍，因為他們已經與約書亞和以色列人講和了。<br>Come up to me and help me, and let us strike Gibeon; for they have made peace with Joshua and the children of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>10:5</a></td><td class=td>於是亞摩利人的五個王，就是耶路撒冷王、希伯侖王、耶末王、拉吉王、伊磯倫王，一同聚集，率領他們的眾軍上去，對著基遍安營，攻打基遍。<br>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they and all their camps; and they camped against Gibeon and fought against it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>10:6</a></td><td class=td>基遍人就打發人往吉甲的營中去見約書亞，說，你不要袖手不顧你的仆人，求你速速上我們這裏來拯救我們，幫助我們，因為住山地亞摩利人的諸王，都聚集攻擊我們。<br>And the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, Do not let your hand fail your servants. Come up to us quickly; and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who inhabit the hill country are gathered against us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>10:7</a></td><td class=td>於是約書亞和他一切兵丁，並大能的勇士，都從吉甲上去。<br>So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>10:8</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對約書亞說，不要怕他們；因為我已將他們交在你手裏，他們沒有一人能在你麵前站立得住。<br>And Jehovah said to Joshua, Do not be afraid of them, for I have given them into your hand. No man among them will stand before you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>10:9</a></td><td class=td>約書亞就終夜從吉甲上去，猛然臨到他們那裏。<br>So Joshua came upon them suddenly, for he journeyed from Gilgal all night long.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>10:10</a></td><td class=td>耶和華使他們在以色列人麵前潰亂，在基遍大大的擊殺他們，沿著伯和侖的上坡路追趕他們，擊殺他們，直到亞西加和瑪基大。<br>And Jehovah threw them into a panic before Israel, and He struck them with a great stroke at Gibeon; and He pursued them on the way toward the ascent of Beth-horon; and He struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>10:11</a></td><td class=td>他們在以色列人麵前逃跑，正在伯和侖下坡的時候，耶和華從天上降大冰雹在他們身上，直降到亞西加，打死他們。被冰雹打死的，比以色列人用刀殺死的還多。<br>And while they fled from before Israel, when they were on the descent of Beth-horon, Jehovah sent large stones upon them from heaven as far as Azekah, and they died. There were more who died because of the hailstones than the children of Israel slew with the sword.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>10:12</a></td><td class=td>當耶和華將亞摩利人交付以色列人的日子，約書亞向耶和華禱告，在以色列人眼前說，日頭阿，你要停在基遍；月亮阿，你要止在亞雅侖穀。<br>Then Joshua spoke to Jehovah on the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, be still over Gibeon; And you, Moon, over the valley of Aijalon!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>10:13</a></td><td class=td>於是日頭停留，月亮止住，直等國民向敵人報了仇。這事豈不是寫在雅煞珥書上麼？日頭在天當中停住，不急速下落，約有一整日。<br>And the sun was still, And the moon stayed, Until the nation avenged themselves of their enemies. Is it not written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the middle of the heavens, and it did not hurry to set for about a whole day.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>10:23</a></td><td class=td>眾人就這樣行，將那五王，就是耶路撒冷王、希伯侖王、耶末王、拉吉王、伊磯倫王，從洞裏帶出來，領到約書亞那裏。<br>And they did so; and they brought those kings out of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>10:24</a></td><td class=td>他們把那五王帶出來，領到約書亞那裏的時候，約書亞就召了以色列眾人來，對那些和他同去之兵丁的首領說，你們近前來，把腳踏在這些王的頸項上。他們就近前來，把腳踏在這些王的頸項上。<br>And when they brought out those five kings to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel; and he said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him, Come near; put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near and put their feet upon their necks.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>10:25</a></td><td class=td>約書亞對他們說，你們不要懼怕，也不要驚惶；應當剛強壯膽，因為耶和華必這樣待你們所要攻打的一切仇敵。<br>And Joshua said to them, Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and take courage, for thus will Jehovah do to all your enemies against whom you fight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>10:26</a></td><td class=td>隨後約書亞將這五王殺死，掛在五棵樹上；他們就在樹上直掛到晚上。<br>And Joshua struck them after that and put them to death, and he hung them on five trees; and they hung upon the trees until evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>10:27</a></td><td class=td>日頭要落的時候，約書亞一吩咐，人就把屍首從樹上取下來，丟在他們藏過的洞裏，把幾塊大石頭放在洞口，直存到今日。<br>And when the sun set, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden; and they put large stones over the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.</td></tr>
