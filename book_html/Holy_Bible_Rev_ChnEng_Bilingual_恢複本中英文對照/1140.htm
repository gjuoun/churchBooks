<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>7:1</a></td><td class=td>這麥基洗德，撒冷王，至高神的祭司，就是那當亞伯拉罕殺敗諸王回來的時候，迎接他，並給他祝福的。<br>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>7:2</a></td><td class=td>亞伯拉罕也將所得的一切，分了十分之一給他。首先，他的名字翻出來是公義王；其次，他又是撒冷王，就是平安王。<br>To whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all; first being interpreted king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>7:3</a></td><td class=td>他無父，無母，無族譜，既無時日之始，也無生命之終，乃與神的兒子相似，是永久為祭司的。<br>Being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>7:4</a></td><td class=td>你們要想想，先祖亞伯拉罕把上等擄物中的十分之一給他，這人是何等尊大！<br>And consider how great this one was, to whom the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the choice spoils. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>7:5</a></td><td class=td>那些領受祭司職任的利未子孫，奉命照著律法從百姓，就是從他們的弟兄，收取十分之一，盡管他們的弟兄是從亞伯拉罕腰中出來的；<br>And they of the sons of Levi, who received the priestly service, have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, though they have come forth from the loins of Abraham. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>7:6</a></td><td class=td>但那不與他們同譜係的，倒收取亞伯拉罕的十分之一，並為那蒙受應許的祝福。<br>But he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes from Abraham and has blessed him who has the promises. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>7:7</a></td><td class=td>向來都是卑小的蒙尊優的祝福，這是一無可駁的。<br>But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>7:8</a></td><td class=td>在這裏，收取十分之一的，是必死的人；在那裏，卻是那被證實為活著的。<br>And here men, who die, receive tithes; but there, one of whom it is testified that he lives. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>7:9</a></td><td class=td>並且可以這樣說，那收取十分之一的利未，也是藉著亞伯拉罕納了十分之一；<br>And, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, he who receives tithes, has been made to pay tithes, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>7:10</a></td><td class=td>因為麥基洗德迎接亞伯拉罕的時候，利未還在他祖宗的腰中。<br>For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>7:11</a></td><td class=td>這樣，藉著利未人的祭司職分，若真能使人得完全，（百姓原是根據這職分領受了律法，）又何需另外興起一位祭司，照著麥基洗德的等次，不照著亞倫的等次來稱謂？<br>If indeed then perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what need was there still that a different Priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec and that He should not be said to be according to the order of Aaron? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>7:12</a></td><td class=td>祭司的職分既已更換，律法也必須更換。<br>For since the priesthood is transferred, of necessity there comes into being a transfer of law also. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>7:13</a></td><td class=td>因為這些話所說到的人，原有分於別的支派，那支派裏沒有一人伺候過祭壇。<br>For He of whom these things are said belongs to a different tribe, from which no one has attended to the altar. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>7:14</a></td><td class=td>我們的主明顯是從猶大支派出來的；論到這支派，摩西並沒有講到祭司的事。<br>For it is evident that our Lord has risen out of Judah, concerning which tribe Moses spoke nothing about priests. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>7:15</a></td><td class=td>既然照麥基洗德的樣式，興起一位不同的祭司來，我們的話就更是顯然的了；<br>And it is still more abundantly evident since it is according to the likeness of Melchisedec that a different Priest arises, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>7:16</a></td><td class=td>祂成了祭司，不是照著屬肉之誡命的律法，乃是照著不能毀壞之生命的大能；<br>Who has been appointed not according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>7:17</a></td><td class=td>因為有為祂作見證的說，“你是照著麥基洗德的等次，永遠為祭司。”<br>For it is testified, "You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>7:18</a></td><td class=td>一麵是先前的誡命，因其軟弱和無益，而被廢掉，<br>For there is, on the one hand, the setting aside of the preceding commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>7:19</a></td><td class=td>（律法原來一無所成，）另一麵卻在其上引進更美的盼望，藉此我們可以親近神。<br>(For the law perfected nothing), and, on the other hand, the bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>7:20</a></td><td class=td>再者，耶穌為祭司，既不是不起誓立的，<br>And inasmuch as He was not made a Priest without the taking of an oath </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>7:21</a></td><td class=td>（那些人為祭司，原不是起誓立的，耶穌卻是起誓立的，是藉著那對祂說，“主起了誓絕不後悔，你是永遠為祭司”的，）<br>(For they are appointed priests without the taking of an oath, but He, with the taking of an oath by Him who said to Him, "The Lord has sworn and will not regret it, You are a Priest forever''), </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>7:22</a></td><td class=td>祂就成了更美之約的保證。<br>By so much Jesus has also become the surety of a better covenant. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>7:23</a></td><td class=td>那些為祭司的，人數眾多，是因為有死攔阻，不能長久；<br>And they are appointed priests many in number because death prevents them from continuing; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>7:24</a></td><td class=td>但耶穌既是永遠長存的，祂就有不能更換的祭司職分。<br>But He, because He abides forever, has His priesthood unalterable. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>7:25</a></td><td class=td>所以，那藉著祂來到神麵前的人，祂都能拯救到底；因為祂是長遠活著，為他們代求。<br>Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>7:26</a></td><td class=td>像這樣聖而無邪惡、無玷汙、與罪人分別，並且高過諸天的大祭司，原是與我們合宜的；<br>For such a High Priest was also fitting to us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners and having become higher than the heavens, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>7:27</a></td><td class=td>祂不像那些大祭司，每天必須先為自己的罪，再為百姓的罪獻上祭物，因為祂獻上自己，就把這事一次永遠的作成了。<br>Who does not have daily need, as the high priests do, to offer up sacrifices first for his own sins and then for those of the people; for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>7:28</a></td><td class=td>律法本是立軟弱的人為大祭司，但在律法以後所起誓的話，卻是立兒子為大祭司，乃是成全直到永遠的。<br>For the law establishes men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which was after the law, establishes the Son, perfected forever. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
