<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>12:1</a></td><td class=td>這時，有數萬群眾聚集，甚至彼此踐踏，耶穌開講，先對門徒說，你們自己要提防法利賽人的酵，就是假冒為善。<br>Meanwhile, when the myriads of the crowd were gathered together so that they trampled on one another, He began to say to His disciples first, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>12:2</a></td><td class=td>隻是完全掩蓋的事沒有不被揭露的，隱藏的事沒有不被人知道的。<br>But there is nothing covered up which will not be revealed, and hidden which will not be known. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>12:3</a></td><td class=td>所以你們在暗中所說的，將要在明處被聽見；在內室附耳所說的，將要在房頂上被宣揚。<br>Therefore what you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear in the private rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>12:4</a></td><td class=td>我的朋友，我對你們說，不要怕那些殺身體，以後不能再作什麼的。<br>And I say to you My friends, Do not fear those who kill the body and afterward have nothing more that they can do. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>12:5</a></td><td class=td>我要指示你們當怕的是誰；當怕那殺了以後，又有權柄扔在火坑裏的；我實在告訴你們，正要怕祂。<br>But I will show you whom you should fear: fear Him who, after killing, has authority to cast into Gehenna; yes, I tell you, fear this One. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>12:6</a></td><td class=td>五隻麻雀不是賣二個銅錢麼？在神麵前一隻也不會忘記。<br>Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria? And not one of them is forgotten before God. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>12:8</a></td><td class=td>我又告訴你們，凡在人麵前，在我裏麵承認我的，人子在神的使者麵前，也必在他裏麵承認他；<br>Moreover, I tell you, Everyone who confesses in Me before men, the Son of Man will also confess in him before the angels of God; </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>12:11</a></td><td class=td>人帶你們到會堂、官長和有權柄的人麵前，不要憂慮該怎麼分訴，或分訴什麼，或該說什麼；<br>And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious about how or what you should reply in defense, or what you should say; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>12:12</a></td><td class=td>因為在那時刻，聖靈自會教導你們當說的話。<br>For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour what should be said. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>12:14</a></td><td class=td>耶穌對他說，人哪，誰立我作你們的審判官，或分家業的人？<br>But He said to him, Man, who appointed Me a judge or a divider over you? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>12:15</a></td><td class=td>於是對眾人說，你們要當心，要自守，免去一切的貪婪；因為人的生命，不在於家業豐富。<br>And He said to them, Watch and guard yourself from all covetousness, for no one's life is in the abundance of his possessions. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>12:16</a></td><td class=td>耶穌就告訴他們一個比喻，說，有一個財主的田地出產豐盛；<br>And He told them a parable, saying, The land of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>12:17</a></td><td class=td>他自己心裏思量說，我的出產沒有地方收藏，怎麼辦？<br>And he reasoned in himself, saying, What shall I do, for I have no place where I may gather my crops? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>12:18</a></td><td class=td>又說，我要這樣辦：要把我的倉房拆了，另蓋更大的，好在那裏收藏我一切的麥子和財物。<br>And he said, I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and I will gather there all my wheat and my goods. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>12:19</a></td><td class=td>然後要對我的魂說，魂哪，你有許多財物積存，可供多年享用，你休息吧，吃喝快樂吧。<br>And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; rest, eat, drink, be merry. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>12:20</a></td><td class=td>神卻對他說，無知的人哪，今夜必要你的魂；你所預備的，要歸誰？<br>But God said to him, Foolish one, this night they are requiring your soul from you; and the things which you have prepared, whose will they be? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>12:21</a></td><td class=td>那為自己積財，對神卻不富足的，也是這樣。<br>So is he who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>12:22</a></td><td class=td>耶穌又對門徒說，所以我告訴你們，不要為生命憂慮，吃什麼，也不要為身體憂慮，穿什麼。<br>And He said to His disciples, Therefore I say to you, Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat; nor for your body, what you should put on; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>12:23</a></td><td class=td>因為生命勝於食物，身體勝於衣服。<br>For the life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>12:24</a></td><td class=td>你們想烏鴉，它們既不種，也不收，沒有倉，也沒有庫，神尚且養活它們。你們比飛鳥貴重多了。<br>Consider the ravens. They neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn; yet God nourishes them. How much more valuable are you than the birds! </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>12:25</a></td><td class=td>你們中間誰能因憂慮使自己的身量多加一肘？<br>And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his stature? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>12:26</a></td><td class=td>這最小的事，你們尚且不能作，為什麼還憂慮其餘的事？<br>If then you cannot do even the least, why are you anxious about the rest? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>12:27</a></td><td class=td>你們想百合花，怎樣生長；它們既不勞苦，也不紡線。但我告訴你們，就是所羅門在他極盛的榮耀裏，也沒有披戴得像這些花中的一朵。<br>Consider the lilies, how they grow; they do not toil nor even spin thread; but I tell you, Not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>12:28</a></td><td class=td>小信的人哪，野地裏的草，今天存在，明天就丟在爐裏，神尚且這樣給它穿戴，何況你們？<br>Now if God so arrays the grass in the field, which is here today and tomorrow is cast into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you, you of little faith! </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>12:29</a></td><td class=td>你們不要尋求吃什麼，喝什麼，也不要掛心。<br>And you, do not seek what you shall eat and what you shall drink, and do not be unsettled. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>12:30</a></td><td class=td>因為這一切都是世上外邦人所急切尋求的，你們的父卻知道你們需要這一切。<br>For all these things the Gentiles of the world are anxiously seeking, but your Father knows that you need these things. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>12:31</a></td><td class=td>但你們要尋求祂的國，這些就都要加給你們了。<br>However, seek His kingdom, and these things shall be added to you. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>12:33</a></td><td class=td>要變賣你們的家業，施舍給人；為自己預備永不舊的錢袋，用不盡的財寶在諸天之上，就是賊不能近，蟲不能蛀的地方。<br>Sell your possessions and give alms; make for yourselves purses which do not become old, an unfailing treasure in the heavens, where thief does not come near nor even moth corrupts; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>12:34</a></td><td class=td>因為你們的財寶在那裏，你們的心也必在那裏。<br>For where your treasure is, there also your heart will be. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>12:35</a></td><td class=td>你們腰間要束上帶，燈也要點著，<br>Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>12:36</a></td><td class=td>自己好像人等候他們的主人從婚筵上回來，他來到叩門，就立即給他開門。<br>And you be like men waiting for their own master when he returns from the wedding feast, so that when he comes and knocks they may open to him immediately. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>12:37</a></td><td class=td>主人來了，看見奴仆儆醒，那些奴仆就有福了。我實在告訴你們，主人必自己束上帶，叫他們坐席，進前服事他們。<br>Blessed are those slaves whom the master, when he comes, will find watching. Truly I tell you that he will gird himself and will have them recline at table, and he will come to them and serve them. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>12:38</a></td><td class=td>他或是二更天來，或是三更天來，看見他們這樣，那些奴仆就有福了。<br>And if he comes in the second watch, or if in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=40>12:40</a></td><td class=td>你們也要預備，因為在你們想不到的時辰，人子就來了。<br>You also, be ready, because at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=41>12:41</a></td><td class=td>彼得說，主啊，這比喻是對我們說的，還是也對眾人說的？<br>And Peter said, Lord, are You saying this parable to us, or also to all? </td></tr>
