<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>20:1</a></td><td class=td>我又看見一位天使從天降下，手裏拿著無底坑的鑰匙，和一條大鎖鏈。<br>And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>20:2</a></td><td class=td>他捉住那龍，就是古蛇，也就是魔鬼，撒但，把他捆綁一千年，<br>And he laid hold of the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>20:3</a></td><td class=td>扔在無底坑裏，關起來，封上印，使他不得再迷惑列國，等那一千年完了；以後必須暫時釋放他。<br>And cast him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, that he might not deceive the nations any longer until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be loosed for a little while. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>20:4</a></td><td class=td>我又看見幾個寶座和坐在上麵的，有審判的權柄賜給他們。我又看見那些為耶穌的見證、並為神的話被斬者，以及那些沒有拜過獸與獸像，額上和手上也沒有受過它印記之人的魂，他們都活了，與基督一同作王一千年。<br>And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and of those who had not worshipped the beast nor his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>20:6</a></td><td class=td>在頭一次複活有分的有福了，聖別了，第二次的死在他們身上沒有權柄；他們還要作神和基督的祭司，並要與基督一同作王一千年。<br>Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>20:7</a></td><td class=td>那一千年完了，撒但必從監牢裏被釋放，<br>And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>20:8</a></td><td class=td>要出來迷惑地上四方的列國，就是歌革和瑪各，叫他們聚集爭戰，他們的數目多如海沙。<br>And will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war. Their number is like that of the sand of the sea. </td></tr>
