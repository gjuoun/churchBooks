<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>19:5</a></td><td class=td>耶穌出來，戴著荊棘冠冕，穿著紫袍。彼拉多對他們說，看哪，這個人。<br>Then Jesus came out, wearing the thorny crown and the purple garment. And he said to them, Behold, the man! </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>19:6</a></td><td class=td>祭司長和差役看見祂，就喊著說，釘祂十字架！釘祂十字架！彼拉多說，你們自己把祂帶去釘十字架吧，因為我查不出祂有什麼該定罪的。<br>When therefore the chief priests and the attendants saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify! Crucify! Pilate said to them, You take Him and crucify Him, for I do not find fault in Him. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>19:11</a></td><td class=td>耶穌回答說，若不是從上頭賜給你的，你就毫無權柄辦我；所以把我交給你的那人，罪更重了。<br>Jesus answered him, You would have no authority against Me if it were not given to you from above; for this reason, he who has delivered Me to you has the greater sin. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>19:12</a></td><td class=td>從此彼拉多想要釋放耶穌，無奈猶太人喊著說，你若釋放這個人，就不是該撒的朋友；凡自命為王的，就是反對該撒了。<br>From then on, Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar; every one who makes himself a king opposes Caesar. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>19:15</a></td><td class=td>他們喊著說，除掉祂，除掉祂，釘祂十字架！彼拉多對他們說，我可以把你們的王釘十字架麼？祭司長回答說，除了該撒，我們沒有王。<br>They cried out then, Take Him away! Take Him away! Crucify Him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king except Caesar. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>19:16</a></td><td class=td>於是彼拉多將耶穌交給他們釘十字架。<br>Therefore at that time he delivered Him to them that He might be crucified. Therefore they took Jesus. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>19:17</a></td><td class=td>他們就把耶穌帶了去。耶穌自己背著十字架出來，到了一個地方，名叫髑髏地，希伯來話叫各各他。<br>And bearing the cross for Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha, </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>19:19</a></td><td class=td>彼拉多又寫了一個標示，安在十字架上，寫的是：猶太人的王拿撒勒人耶穌。<br>And Pilate wrote a notice also and put it on the cross; and it was written, Jesus The Nazarene, The King Of The JEWS. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>19:20</a></td><td class=td>有許多猶太人念這標示，因為耶穌被釘十字架的地方與城相近，並且這標示是用希伯來文、羅馬文、希利尼文寫的。<br>This notice therefore many of the Jews read, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>19:21</a></td><td class=td>猶太人的祭司長就對彼拉多說，不要寫猶太人的王；要寫這個人自己說，我是猶太人的王。<br>The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews, but that He said, I am the King of the JEWS. </td></tr>

But the tunic was seamless, woven from the top throughout. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>19:24</a></td><td class=td>他們就彼此說，我們不要撕開，隻要拈鬮，看誰得著。這是要應驗經書：“他們分了我的外衣，又為我的衣服拈鬮。”兵丁果然作了這事。<br>They said therefore to one another, Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots for it to see whose it shall be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, "They divided My garments among themselves, and for My clothing they cast lots.'' So then the soldiers did these things. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>19:28</a></td><td class=td>這事以後，耶穌知道各樣的事已經成就，為要成就經書，就說，我渴了。<br>After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had now been finished and so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>19:29</a></td><td class=td>有一個器皿盛滿了醋，放在那裏；他們就拿海綿蘸滿了醋，綁在牛膝草上，送到祂口邊。<br>There was lying there a vessel full of vinegar; therefore, they put a sponge full of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>19:30</a></td><td class=td>耶穌受了那醋，就說，成了！便低下頭，將靈交付了。<br>Then when Jesus had taken the vinegar, He said, It is finished! And He bowed His head and delivered up His spirit. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>19:31</a></td><td class=td>猶太人因這日是預備日，又因那安息日是個大日，就求彼拉多叫人打斷他們的腿，把他們拿去，免得身體當安息日留在十字架上。<br>Then the Jews, since it was the day of preparation and so that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath day was a great Sabbath), requested of Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>19:32</a></td><td class=td>於是兵丁來，把頭一個人的腿，並與耶穌同釘另一個人的腿，都打斷了；<br>The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other man who had been crucified with Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>19:33</a></td><td class=td>隻是來到耶穌那裏，見祂已經死了，就不打斷祂的腿。<br>But coming to Jesus, when they saw that He had already died, they did not break His legs; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>19:34</a></td><td class=td>惟有一個兵用槍紮祂的肋旁，隨即有血和水流出來。<br>But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>19:36</a></td><td class=td>這些事發生，為要應驗經書：“祂的骨頭，一根也不可折斷。”<br>For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled: "No bone of His shall be broken.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>19:37</a></td><td class=td>另有一處經書說，“他們要仰望自己所紮的人。”<br>And again another Scripture says, "They shall look on Him whom they pierced.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>19:38</a></td><td class=td>這些事以後，有亞利馬太人約瑟，是耶穌的門徒，隻因怕猶太人，就暗暗的作門徒，他求彼拉多，要領耶穌的身體，彼拉多準許了，他就來把耶穌的身體領去。<br>And after these things Joseph from Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a hidden one for fear of the Jews, requested of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus away; and Pilate allowed it.
