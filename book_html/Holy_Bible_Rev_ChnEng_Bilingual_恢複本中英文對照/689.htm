<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>10:1</a></td><td class=td>禍哉，那些製定不義之律例，忙於記錄凶惡之判語的；<br>Woe to those who decree decrees of iniquity, To the busy writers who are busy writing trouble,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>10:2</a></td><td class=td>他們要藉此屈枉窮乏人的案情，奪去我民中困苦人的公理，好使寡婦成為他們的擄物，孤兒成為他們的掠物。<br>In order to turn the poor away from judgment, And to tear justice away from the afflicted among my people; That widows may be their spoil, And they may plunder orphans.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>10:3</a></td><td class=td>到降罰的日子，有災禍從遠方臨到，那時你們怎樣行呢？你們向誰逃奔求助呢？你們的榮耀撇在何處呢？<br>And what will you do for the day of visitation, And for the devastation that comes from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>10:4</a></td><td class=td>他們隻得屈身在被擄的人以下，仆倒在被殺的人以下。雖然如此，耶和華的怒氣還未轉消，祂的手仍然伸出。<br>Unless one crouches behind prisoners, And they fall behind the slain? By all this His anger is not turned; His hand is still outstretched.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>10:5</a></td><td class=td>禍哉，亞述，我怒氣的棍！他們手中的杖就是我的惱恨。<br>Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger! The staff which is in their hand is My indignation.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>10:6</a></td><td class=td>我打發他攻擊不虔敬的國，吩咐他攻擊我盛怒之下的百姓，搶擄來之財為擄物，奪掠來之貨為掠物，將他們踐踏，像街上的泥土一樣。<br>Against a profane nation I send them out, And against the people of My overflowing wrath I command them, To make spoil of the spoil and to make plunder of the plunder, To make them a trampling  ground, like street mire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>10:7</a></td><td class=td>然而他不這樣想，他心也不這樣打算；他心裏倒想毀滅、剪除不少的國。<br>But they do not think so, And their heart does not conceive it so; For destroying is in their heart, And the cutting down of no few nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>10:8</a></td><td class=td>他說，我的臣宰豈不都是王麼？<br>For they say, Are not my princes all kings?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>10:9</a></td><td class=td>迦勒挪豈不像迦基米施麼？哈馬豈不像亞珥拔麼？撒瑪利亞豈不像大馬色麼？<br>Is not Calno like Carchemish, Or Hamath like Arpad, Or Samaria like Damascus?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>10:10</a></td><td class=td>我的手既已構到有偶像的國，這些國雕製的偶像勝過耶路撒冷和撒瑪利亞的偶像，<br>Since my hand has reached The kingdoms of the idols, And their graven images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>10:11</a></td><td class=td>我怎樣待撒瑪利亞和其中的偶像，豈不照樣待耶路撒冷和其中的偶像麼？<br>Shall I not do, as I have done To Samaria and its idols, The same to Jerusalem and its images?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>10:12</a></td><td class=td>但主在錫安山和耶路撒冷成就祂一切工作的時候，祂說，我必罰亞述王自大之心的果子，和他高傲眼目的榮耀。<br>But when the Lord has completed all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, He says, I will punish the fruit of the king of Assyria's haughtiness of heart and the glory of his haughty eyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>10:13</a></td><td class=td>因為他說，我所成就的事，是靠我手的能力和我的智慧；我本有聰明。我挪移眾民的地界，搶奪他們所積蓄的財寶，並且我像勇士，使坐寶座的降為卑。<br>For he has said, By the strength of my own hand I have done it, And by my own wisdom; for I have understanding. And I have removed the boundaries of the peoples; And their stored possessions I have plundered. And like a bull, I brought down those who sit on thrones.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>10:14</a></td><td class=td>我的手構到眾民的財寶，好像人構到鳥窩；我也收聚了全地，好像人收聚被棄的雀蛋；沒有動翅膀的，沒有張嘴的，也沒有鳴叫的。<br>And my hand reached in, like in a nest, For the wealth of the peoples; And like one who gathers abandoned eggs, I myself gathered in all the earth; And none fluttered a wing, Or opened a beak and chirped.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>10:15</a></td><td class=td>斧豈可向用斧砍伐的自誇呢？鋸豈可向用鋸的自大呢？好比棍掄起那舉棍的，好比杖舉起那不是木頭的人。<br>Should the ax glorify itself above him who chops with it? Or should the saw magnify itself above him who wields it? It would be like the rod wielding him who lifts it up, Like the staff lifting up him who is not wood.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>10:16</a></td><td class=td>因此，主萬軍之耶和華必使亞述王的肥壯人變為瘦弱；在他的榮耀之下，必使火著起，如同焚燒一樣。<br>Therefore the Lord Jehovah of hosts will send Leanness to his fat ones; And under his glory He will kindle a kindling, Like the kindling of fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>10:17</a></td><td class=td>以色列的光必成為火，他的聖者必成為火焰；在一日之間，將亞述王的荊棘和蒺藜，焚燒且燒滅；<br>And the Light of Israel will become a fire, And His Holy One a flame; And it will burn and devour his thorns And his thistles in one day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>10:18</a></td><td class=td>又將他樹林和肥田的榮耀，全然滅盡；他必像患病的人漸漸瘦弱一樣。<br>The glory of his forest and of his garden land He will destroy, both soul and body; And he will be like a sick man wasting away.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>10:19</a></td><td class=td>他林中剩下的樹必稀少，就是孩子也能寫其數。<br>And what is left of the trees of his forest will be so few in number That a young boy could record them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>10:20</a></td><td class=td>到那日，以色列所剩下的，和雅各家所逃脫的，必不再倚靠那擊打他們的，卻要誠實信靠耶和華以色列的聖者。<br>Then in that day the remnant of Israel and those of the house of Jacob who have escaped will no longer rely upon him who strikes them, but they will rely upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>10:21</a></td><td class=td>所剩下的，就是雅各家所剩下的，必歸回全能的神。<br>A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>10:22</a></td><td class=td>以色列阿，你的百姓雖多如海沙，惟有剩下的歸回。滅絕的事已定，必有公義如水漲溢。<br>For though your people, O Israel, are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant among them will return. Annihilation is strictly decided, overflowing with righteousness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>10:23</a></td><td class=td>因為主萬軍之耶和華，正在全地之中成就所定滅絕的事。<br>For utter destruction and a strict decision is the Lord Jehovah of hosts performing in the midst of the whole land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>10:24</a></td><td class=td>所以主萬軍之耶和華如此說，住錫安我的百姓阿，亞述雖然用棍擊打你，又照埃及所行的舉杖攻擊你，你卻不要怕他。<br>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah of hosts, O my people dwelling in Zion, do not fear Assyria, who strike with the rod and lift up their staff against you the way Egypt did.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>10:25</a></td><td class=td>因為還有一點點時候，我向你發的忿恨就要完畢，我的怒氣要轉向他們，使他們滅亡。<br>For in a very little while My indignation will be completed, and My anger will be turned toward their destruction.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>10:26</a></td><td class=td>萬軍之耶和華要興起鞭來攻擊他們，好像在俄立磐石那裏擊殺米甸人一樣；耶和華的杖要向海伸出，祂要照祂在埃及所行的，把杖舉起。<br>And against them Jehovah of hosts will rouse up a whip like the stroke against Midian at the rock of Oreb; and His staff will be over the sea, and He will lift it up the way He did in Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>10:27</a></td><td class=td>到那日，亞述的重擔必離開你的肩頭，他的軛必離開你的頸項；那軛也必因肥壯的緣故撐斷。<br>And in that day their burden will be removed from your shoulders, and their yoke from off your neck; and the yoke will be broken due to the fatness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>10:28</a></td><td class=td>亞述來攻擊亞葉，經過米磯侖，在密抹安放輜重。<br>He comes against Aiath; He passes through Migron; At Michmash he deposits his gear.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>10:29</a></td><td class=td>他們過了隘口，說，迦巴是我們住宿的地方。拉瑪人戰兢；掃羅的基比亞人逃跑。<br>They go through the pass, saying, Geba will be our lodging  overnight. Ramah is quaking; Gibeah of Saul flees away.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>10:30</a></td><td class=td>迦琳的女子阿，要高聲呼喊！萊煞人哪，要留心聽！哀哉，困苦的亞拿突人哪！<br>Scream with your voice, O daughter of Gallim! Listen carefully, Laishah! O poor Anathoth!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>10:31</a></td><td class=td>瑪得米那人逃遁；基柄的居民避難。<br>Madmenah flees; The inhabitants of Gebim seek refuge.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>10:32</a></td><td class=td>直到今日仍是如此；亞述在挪伯停留，向錫安女子的山，就是耶路撒冷的岡陵，掄手攻擊。<br>So it is until this day when he halts  at Nob. He swings his hand over the mountain of the daughter of Zion, Over the hill of Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>10:33</a></td><td class=td>看哪，主萬軍之耶和華以可怕的震撼削去樹枝：長高的必被砍下，高大的必被伐低。<br>But now the Lord Jehovah of hosts Is lopping off the boughs with an awful crash: Those which are tall in height are hewn down, And those which are lofty are laid low.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>10:34</a></td><td class=td>祂要用鐵器砍下叢林；利巴嫩必倒在威嚴者手下。<br>And He chops away the forest thickets with an iron ax; And Lebanon falls at the hands of a majestic One.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
