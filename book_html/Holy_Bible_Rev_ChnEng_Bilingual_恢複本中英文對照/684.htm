<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>5:1</a></td><td class=td>我要歌唱我所親愛的，唱我所愛者的歌，論到祂的葡萄園。我所親愛的有葡萄園，在肥美的山岡上。<br>Let me sing of my Beloved, A song of my Beloved concerning His vineyard. My Beloved had a vineyard On a fertile hill.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>5:2</a></td><td class=td>祂刨挖園子，清除石頭，栽種上等的葡萄樹，又在園中蓋了一座樓，鑿出壓酒池；指望結好葡萄，反倒結了野葡萄。<br>And He dug it up and cleared away its stones, And He planted it with the choicest vine. Then He built a tower in the middle of it, And hewed out a wine vat in it. And He looked for it to produce grapes, But it produced only wild grapes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>5:3</a></td><td class=td>耶路撒冷的居民和猶大人哪，請你們現今在我與我的葡萄園之間，作個評斷。<br>So then, you inhabitants of Jerusalem And you men of Judah, Judge between Me And My vineyard.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>5:4</a></td><td class=td>我為我的葡萄園，還可以作什麼，是我沒有作過的呢？我指望結好葡萄，怎麼倒結了野葡萄呢？<br>What more could I have done for My vineyard That I have not already done for  it? Why then, when I looked for it to produce grapes, Did it produce only wild grapes?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>5:5</a></td><td class=td>現在我告訴你們，我要向我的葡萄園怎樣行：我必撤去它的籬笆，使它被吞滅；拆毀它的牆垣，使它被踐踏。<br>And now I will make known to you What I will now do to My vineyard: I will remove its hedge, and it will be consumed; I will break down its wall, and it will become a trampled place.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>5:6</a></td><td class=td>我必使它荒廢，不再修理，不再鋤刨；荊棘蒺藜倒要生長。我也必命雲不降雨在其上。<br>And I will make it a waste; It will not be pruned, nor will it be hoed; But thorns and thistles will come on it. And I will command the clouds Not to rain upon it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>5:7</a></td><td class=td>原來萬軍之耶和華的葡萄園就是以色列家，祂所喜悅的樹就是猶大人；祂指望的是公平，誰知倒有流血！指望的是公義，誰知倒有哀聲！<br>For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, And the men of Judah, the plant of His good pleasure; And He expected justice, but instead, bloodshed! He expected righteousness, but instead, an outcry of distress!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>5:8</a></td><td class=td>禍哉，那些以房接房，以地連地，以致不留餘地，隻顧自己獨居境內的人！<br>Woe to those who join house to house, Who lay field to field, Till there is no place left, And you dwell alone in the midst of the land!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>5:9</a></td><td class=td>我耳聞萬軍之耶和華起誓說，必有許多房屋成為荒涼，又大又美的房屋無人居住。<br>In my ears Jehovah of hosts has  sworn: Many houses shall indeed become desolate; Great ones and fine ones shall be without inhabitants.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>5:10</a></td><td class=td>因為十畝葡萄園隻出一罷特酒，一賀梅珥穀種隻結一伊法糧食。<br>For ten acres of vineyard will produce a mere bath of wine, And a homer of seed will produce an ephah of grain.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>5:11</a></td><td class=td>禍哉，那些清早起來追求濃酒，留連到夜深，以致因酒發燒的人！<br>Woe to those who rise early in the morning That they may run after liquor, To those who linger into the  evening That wine may inflame them!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>5:12</a></td><td class=td>他們在筵席上彈琴、鼓瑟、擊鼓、吹笛、飲酒，卻不顧念耶和華的作為，也不留心祂手所作的。<br>Lyre and harp, tambourine and  flute, And wine are the essence of their banquets; And they do not consider what has been done by Jehovah, Nor do they regard the work of His hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>5:13</a></td><td class=td>所以我的百姓因無知就被遷徙；他們的尊貴人成了饑餓的民，群眾極其幹渴。<br>Hence, my people go into exile For lack of knowledge; Their nobility become famished  men, And their multitudes, parched with thirst.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>5:14</a></td><td class=td>故此，陰間擴張其欲，大開其口，沒有限量；耶路撒冷的榮美、群眾、喧嘩、並在其中歡樂的人，都落入陰間。<br>Hence, Sheol enlarges its appetite And opens its mouth wide, without limit, And Jerusalem's splendor descends, and her din And her uproar and the jubilant within her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>5:15</a></td><td class=td>平常人屈服，顯貴人降為卑，高傲人的眼目也降為卑；<br>Thus the ordinary man is humbled, and the man of distinction is abased; And the eyes of the haughty are abased;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>5:16</a></td><td class=td>惟有萬軍之耶和華，因審判得高舉，聖別的神，因公義顯為聖別。<br>But Jehovah of hosts is exalted in judgment, And the holy God shows Himself holy in righteousness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>5:17</a></td><td class=td>那時羊羔必來吃草，如同在自己的草場，豐肥人的荒場必被外人吃盡。<br>Then lambs will graze there as in their pasture, And strangers will eat the wastelands of fat men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>5:18</a></td><td class=td>禍哉，那些以虛假之繩索牽罪孽，又像以套繩拉罪惡的人！<br>Woe to those who draw iniquity with ropes of vanity, And sin as with cart ropes;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>5:19</a></td><td class=td>他們說，任祂急速而行，趕快成就祂的作為，使我們可以看見；任以色列聖者所謀畫的臨近成就，使我們可以知道。<br>Who say, He should hurry up; He should hasten His work, So that we may see it; And the counsel of the Holy One of Israel Should draw near and happen, So that we may know it!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>5:20</a></td><td class=td>禍哉，那些稱惡為善，稱善為惡，以暗為光，以光為暗，以苦為甜，以甜為苦的人！<br>Woe to those who call evil good, And good evil; Who put darkness for light, And light for darkness; Who put bitter for sweet, And sweet for bitter!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>5:21</a></td><td class=td>禍哉，那些自視為有智慧，自看為精明的人！<br>Isaiah 5:21 says, "Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, And prudent in their own sight!"</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>5:22</a></td><td class=td>禍哉，那些飲酒的勇士，那些調濃酒的壯士！<br>Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine, And men of valor in mixing  liquor;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>5:23</a></td><td class=td>他們因受賄賂，就定惡人為義，將義人的義奪去。<br>Who acquit the criminal as a result of a bribe, But refuse righteousness to the righteous!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>5:24</a></td><td class=td>火舌怎樣吞滅碎秸，幹草怎樣落在火焰之中，照樣，他們的根必像朽物，他們的花必像灰塵飛揚；因為他們厭棄萬軍之耶和華的訓誨，藐視以色列聖者的言語。<br>Therefore as a tongue of fire consumes the stubble, And the chaff sinks in flames, Their root will be like decay, And their bud will disappear like dust; For they have rejected the instruction of Jehovah of hosts And despised the speaking of the Holy One of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>5:25</a></td><td class=td>所以耶和華的怒氣向祂的百姓發作，祂的手伸出擊打他們。山嶺震動，他們的屍首在街市上好像糞土。雖然如此，祂的怒氣還未轉消，祂的手仍然伸出。<br>For this reason the anger of Jehovah burns against His people, And He stretches out His hand over them and strikes them. And the mountains quake, and their corpses are Like garbage in the middle of the street. In spite of all this His anger is not turned away; Rather, His hand is still stretched out.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>5:26</a></td><td class=td>祂必高舉旌旗，招遠方的國民，發嘯聲叫他們從地極而來；他們必急速奔來。<br>He also lifts up a standard to a distant nation, And whistles to it from the ends of the earth; And indeed it comes with swift speed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>5:27</a></td><td class=td>他們中間沒有疲倦的、絆跌的，沒有打盹的、睡覺的；他們的腰帶並不放鬆，鞋帶也不折斷。<br>None of them is weary, and none stumbles among them; No one slumbers or sleeps; And their belts are not loosened at their waists, Nor are their sandal thongs broken.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>5:28</a></td><td class=td>他們的箭快利，弓也上了弦；馬蹄算如堅石，車輪好像旋風。<br>The arrows of these are  sharpened, And all their bows are drawn; The hooves of their horses are considered to be like flint, And their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>5:29</a></td><td class=td>他們要吼叫像獅子，咆哮像少壯獅子；他們要咆哮抓食，安然叼去，無人搭救。<br>Their roar is like a lion's, And they roar like young lions; When they growl and seize prey, They carry it away safe, and there is none to rescue it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>5:30</a></td><td class=td>那日他們要向以色列人吼叫，像海浪匉訇。人若望地，隻見黑暗艱難，亮光在雲中變為昏暗。<br>And they will growl over it in that day, Like the roaring of the sea. When one will look upon the land, indeed, there will be darkness and distress, And the light will be darkened with its clouds.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
