<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>32:14</a></td><td class=td>也吃牛的奶酪、羊的奶、羊羔的脂油、巴珊所出的公綿羊和山羊、與上好的麥子，也喝葡萄汁釀的酒。<br>Curd of cows and milk of sheep, With fat of lambs, And rams, the offspring of Bashan, and goats, With the choicest wheat; And the blood of the grape you drank as fermenting wine.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>32:15</a></td><td class=td>但耶書侖漸漸肥胖，就踢跳－你肥胖了，粗壯了，飽滿了－便離棄造他的神，輕看救他的磐石。<br>But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked-You have become fat, you have grown thick, you have gorged yourself-And forsook God, who made him, And treated the Rock of his salvation disdainfully.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>32:16</a></td><td class=td>他們以別神觸動神的妒忌，以可憎惡的事惹動祂的怒氣。<br>They made Him jealous with strange gods; With abominations they provoked Him to anger.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>32:17</a></td><td class=td>他們獻祭給鬼魔，給那不是神的，給素不認識的神，給那近來新興的，是你們列祖所不畏懼的。<br>They sacrificed to demons, to those who were no god, To gods they did not know, To new ones who had recently come up, Before whom your fathers had not shuddered.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>32:20</a></td><td class=td>說，我要向他們掩麵，看他們的結局如何。他們本是乖謬的一代，心裏無忠信的兒女。<br>And He said, I will hide My face from them; I will see what their latter end will be. For they are a generation of perversions, Children in whom is no faithfulness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>32:21</a></td><td class=td>他們以那不是神的，觸動我的妒忌；以虛無之物，惹動我的怒氣。我也要以那不是子民的，觸動他們的妒忌；以愚昧的國民，惹動他們的怒氣。<br>They have made Me jealous with a non-God; They have provoked Me to anger with their vanities. Hence I will make them jealous with a non-people; With a foolish nation I will provoke them to anger.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>32:27</a></td><td class=td>但我怕仇敵惹我發怒，恐怕他們的敵人誤斷，說，是我們的手有能力，並非耶和華行了這一切。<br>Except I dreaded the vexation from the enemy; Lest their adversaries misjudge; Lest they say, Our hand is exalted, And it is not Jehovah who has wrought all this.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>32:28</a></td><td class=td>因為以色列人是毫無謀算的國民，心裏沒有聰明。<br>For they are a nation destitute of counsel, And there is no understanding in them.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>32:30</a></td><td class=td>若不是他們的磐石賣了他們，若不是耶和華交出他們，一人焉能追趕他們千人？二人焉能使萬人逃跑呢？<br>How shall one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Were it not that their Rock sold them, And Jehovah delivered them up?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>32:31</a></td><td class=td>連我們的仇敵也斷定，他們的磐石不如我們的磐石。<br>For their rock is not like our Rock; And of this our enemies are judges.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>32:32</a></td><td class=td>他們的葡萄樹是出於所多瑪的葡萄樹，出於蛾摩拉的田野；他們的葡萄是毒葡萄，全掛都是苦的。<br>For their vine is from Sodom's vine, And from Gomorrah's fields; Their grapes are the grapes of poison; Clusters of bitterness have they.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>32:33</a></td><td class=td>他們的酒是大蛇的毒液，是虺蛇殘害的毒素。<br>Their wine is the venom of serpents And the cruel poison of cobras.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>32:35</a></td><td class=td>他們失腳的時候，伸冤報應在我；因他們遭災的日子近了；那注定要臨到他們的，必速速來到。<br>Vengeance is Mine and so is retribution, For the time when their foot slips; Because the day of their calamity has drawn near, And the things destined to happen to them hasten.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>32:36</a></td><td class=td>耶和華見祂百姓能力消逝，無論困住的、自由的，都沒有餘剩，就必為他們伸冤，憐恤祂的仆人。<br>For Jehovah will execute judgment for His people, And He will have compassion on His servants, When He sees that their support is gone, And that neither fettered nor free remain.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>32:37</a></td><td class=td>祂必說，他們的神，他們所投靠的磐石，<br>And He will say, Where are their gods, The rock they sought refuge in,</td></tr>
