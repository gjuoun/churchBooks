<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>惟獨看見耶穌得了榮耀尊貴為冠冕，祂為著受死的苦，成為比天使微小一點的，好叫祂因著神的恩，為樣樣嚐到死味。<br>But we see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything. </td></tr>
