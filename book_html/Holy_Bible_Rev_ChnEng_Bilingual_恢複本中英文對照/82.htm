<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>32:2</a></td><td class=td>亞倫對他們說，把你們妻子、兒子、女兒耳上的金環摘下，拿來給我。<br>And Aaron said to them, Tear off the gold rings, which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>32:3</a></td><td class=td>眾百姓就把他們耳上的金環摘下，拿來給亞倫。<br>And all the people tore off the golden rings which were in their ears and brought them to Aaron.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>32:4</a></td><td class=td>亞倫從他們手裏接過來，鑄了一隻牛犢，是用雕刻的工具作成的。他們就說，以色列阿，這是領你從埃及地上來的神。<br>And he took the gold from their hand and fashioned it with an engraving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>32:5</a></td><td class=td>亞倫看見，就在牛犢麵前築壇，並且宣告說，明日要向耶和華守節。<br>And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; then Aaron made a proclamation and said, Tomorrow shall be a feast to Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>32:6</a></td><td class=td>次日，百姓清早起來，獻上燔祭，並帶來平安祭，然後坐下吃喝，起來玩耍。<br>And they rose up early on the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>32:7</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對摩西說，下去罷，因為你的百姓，就是你從埃及地領上來的，已經敗壞了。<br>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Go, get down; for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>32:8</a></td><td class=td>他們很快就偏離了我所吩咐他們行的道路，為自己鑄了一隻牛犢，向它下拜獻祭，說，以色列阿，這就是領你從埃及地上來的神。<br>They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them. They have made for themselves a molten calf, and they have worshipped it and have sacrificed to it and said, These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>32:11</a></td><td class=td>摩西懇求耶和華他的神，說，耶和華阿，你為什麼向你的百姓發烈怒？這百姓是你用大力並大能的手，從埃及地領出來的。<br>And Moses entreated Jehovah his God and said, Jehovah, why does Your anger burn against Your people, whom You brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>32:12</a></td><td class=td>為什麼使埃及人議論說，祂領他們出去，是要降禍與他們，把他們殺在山中，將他們從地麵上除滅？求你轉意，不發你的烈怒，後悔，不降禍與你的百姓。<br>Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, With evil intent He brought them out, to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from Your burning anger, and repent of this evil against Your people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>32:13</a></td><td class=td>求你記念你的仆人亞伯拉罕、以撒、以色列，你曾指著自己向他們起誓說，我要使你們的後裔繁增，如同天上的星那樣多，並且我要把所應許的這全地，賜給你們的後裔，他們要永遠承受為業。<br>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Yourself and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your seed, and they shall inherit it forever.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>32:18</a></td><td class=td>但摩西說，這不是打勝仗呼喊的聲音；也不是打敗仗呼喊的聲音；我所聽見的，乃是歌唱的聲音。<br>But Moses said, It is not the sound of the cry of triumph, Neither is it the sound of the cry of defeat; But it is the sound of singing that I hear.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>32:19</a></td><td class=td>摩西走近營前，就看見那牛犢，又看見人跳舞，便發烈怒，把兩塊版從手中扔出，在山下摔碎了。<br>And as soon as he drew near to the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing; and Moses' anger burned, and he threw the tablets out of his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>32:21</a></td><td class=td>摩西對亞倫說，這百姓向你作了什麼，你竟使他們陷在這樣大的罪裏？<br>And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people do to you that you brought so great a sin upon them?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>32:22</a></td><td class=td>亞倫說，求我主不要發烈怒。這百姓專於作惡，是你知道的。<br>And Aaron said, Do not let the anger of my lord burn. You know the people, that they are set on evil;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>32:23</a></td><td class=td>他們對我說，你為我們造神像，可以在我們前麵引路；因為領我們從埃及地上來的那人摩西，我們不知道他遭遇了什麼事。<br>For they said to me, Make gods for us who will go before us; for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>32:24</a></td><td class=td>所以我對他們說，凡有金環的，可以摘下來，他們就給了我。我把金環扔在火中，這牛犢便出來了。<br>So I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let them tear it off; so they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and this calf came out.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>32:25</a></td><td class=td>摩西見百姓放肆，(因為亞倫縱容他們，使他們在仇敵中間被譏刺，)<br>And when Moses saw that the people were without restraint (for Aaron had let them be without restraint to be a derision among those who rise up against them),</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>32:26</a></td><td class=td>就站在營門中，說，凡屬耶和華的，都到我這裏來！於是利未的子孫，都到他那裏聚集。<br>Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, Whoever is for Jehovah, come to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>32:27</a></td><td class=td>他對他們說，耶和華以色列的神這樣說，你們各人把刀佩在腰間，在營中往來，從這門到那門，各人殺自己的弟兄、同伴和鄰舍。<br>And he said to them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Let each man put his sword upon his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each man kill his brother, and each man his companion, and each man his neighbor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>32:28</a></td><td class=td>利未的子孫照摩西的話行了；那一天百姓中被殺的約有三千。<br>And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses, and that day about three thousand men among the people fell.</td></tr>
