<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>15:2</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍常常清早起來，站在城門的路旁，凡有爭訟要去求王判斷的，押沙龍就叫他過來，問他說，你是那一城的人？回答說，仆人是以色列某支派的人。<br>And Absalom would rise up early and stand beside the way into the gate; and when any man who had a cause that should have come to the king for judgment  came, Absalom would call to him and say, What city are you from? And he would say, Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>15:3</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍對他說，看哪，你的事有情有理，無奈王沒有委人聽你伸訴。<br>Then Absalom would say to him, See, your matters are good and right, but there is no one  appointed by the king to hear you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>15:4</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍又說，恨不得我被立為這地的士師！凡有爭訟求審判的到我這裏來，我必為他施行公義。<br>And Absalom would say, Oh that I were made a judge in the land, that every man who had a cause or a matter to be judged would come to me, and I would do him justice!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>15:5</a></td><td class=td>若有人近前來要拜押沙龍，押沙龍就伸手拉住他，與他親嘴。<br>And so when any man came near to pay him homage, he would put forth his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>15:6</a></td><td class=td>以色列人中，凡去見王求判斷的，押沙龍都是如此待他們。這樣，押沙龍竊奪了以色列人的心。<br>And Absalom acted in this way to all the Israelites who came to the king for judgment. And Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>15:7</a></td><td class=td>滿了四十年，押沙龍對王說，求你準我離去，在希伯侖還我向耶和華所許的願。<br>And at the end of forty years Absalom said to the king, Let me go now and repay my vow, which I vowed to Jehovah in Hebron.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>15:8</a></td><td class=td>因為你的仆人住在亞蘭的基述時，曾許願說，耶和華若使我回耶路撒冷，我必事奉耶和華。<br>For your servant vowed a vow while I was dwelling in Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, I will worship Jehovah.</td></tr>

Hurry and go, lest he quickly overtake us and bring harm down upon us and strike the city with the edge of the sword.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>15:15</a></td><td class=td>王的臣仆對王說，我主我王所選定的，仆人們在此，都願遵行。<br>And the king's servants said to the king, In all that my lord the king chooses, here we are, your servants.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>15:16</a></td><td class=td>於是王出去了，他的全家都跟隨他；王隻留下十個妃嬪看守宮殿。<br>So the king went forth, and all his house after him. But the king left ten concubines to keep the house.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>15:18</a></td><td class=td>王的臣仆都從他旁邊過去；所有的基利提人、比利提人、和迦特人，就是從迦特跟隨王來的六百人，都在王麵前過去。<br>And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>15:20</a></td><td class=td>你近日才來，而我是能去那裏就去那裏，我今日怎好叫你與我們一同飄流呢？你不如帶你的弟兄回去罷；願耶和華的慈愛和誠實與你同在。<br>You came just recently, so should I today make you wander with us, while I go about wherever I can? Return and take your brothers back; lovingkindness and truth be with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>15:21</a></td><td class=td>以太回答王說，我指著永活的耶和華起誓，又指著我主我王的性命起誓，無論生死，我主我王在那裏，你仆人也必在那裏。<br>But Ittai answered the king and said, As Jehovah lives and as my lord the king lives, in whatever place my lord the king will be, whether for death or for life, there shall your servant most certainly be.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>15:22</a></td><td class=td>大衛對以太說，你前去過溪罷。於是迦特人以太帶著跟隨他的眾人，和所有的婦人孩子，就都過去了。<br>And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the little ones with him passed over.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>15:23</a></td><td class=td>遍地的人都放聲大哭。眾民盡都過去，王也過了汲淪溪；眾民都向著通往曠野的路過去了。<br>And all the land wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over. And the king passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>15:24</a></td><td class=td>看哪，撒督也來了，所有與他在一起的利未人，也抬著神的約櫃來了；他們將神的約櫃放下，亞比亞他上來，等著眾民盡都從城裏出來過去。<br>And there  came Zadok also and all the Levites with him, bearing the Ark of the Covenant of God; and they set the Ark of God down, and Abiathar went up until all the people had finished passing over from the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>15:25</a></td><td class=td>王對撒督說，你將神的約櫃抬回城去。我若在耶和華眼前蒙恩，祂必使我回來，再見約櫃和祂的居所。<br>Then the king said to Zadok, Bring the Ark of God back into the city. If I should find favor in the sight of Jehovah, He will bring me back and show me it and His habitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>15:26</a></td><td class=td>倘若祂這樣說，我不喜悅你，看哪，我在這裏，願祂照自己所看為好的待我。<br>But if He should say thus, I am not pleased with you, let Him then do with me as it seems good in His sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>15:27</a></td><td class=td>王又對祭司撒督說，你不是先見麼？你可以安然回城；你兒子亞希瑪斯和亞比亞他的兒子約拿單，你們的兩個兒子，都可以與你們同去。<br>And the king said to Zadok the priest, You are a seer; return to the city in peace with Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>15:28</a></td><td class=td>看哪，我要在曠野的渡口那裏等候，直到有話從你們那裏來告訴我。<br>See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>15:29</a></td><td class=td>於是撒督和亞比亞他將神的約櫃抬回耶路撒冷，他們就住在那裏。<br>So Zadok and Abiathar brought the Ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>15:30</a></td><td class=td>大衛蒙頭赤腳由橄欖山的上坡上去，一麵上一麵哭。跟隨他的眾人也各自蒙著頭上去，一麵上一麵哭。<br>And David went up the ascent to the  Mount of Olives, weeping as he went up, and he had his head covered and he went barefoot. And all the people who were with him each covered his own head; and they went up, weeping as they went up.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>15:31</a></td><td class=td>有人告訴大衛說，亞希多弗也在叛黨之中，隨從押沙龍。大衛禱告說，耶和華阿，求你使亞希多弗的計謀變為愚拙。<br>Then someone told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, Turn, I pray, the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness, O Jehovah.</td></tr>
