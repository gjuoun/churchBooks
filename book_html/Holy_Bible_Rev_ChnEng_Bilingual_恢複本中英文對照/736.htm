<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>57:4</a></td><td class=td>你們向誰戲笑，向誰張口吐舌呢？你們豈不是悖逆的兒女，虛謊之種麼？<br>Whom are you mocking, And against whom are you opening your mouth wide And sticking out your tongue? Are you not children of transgression, A seed of falsehood,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>57:5</a></td><td class=td>你們在橡樹中間，在各青翠樹下欲火中燒，在山穀間，在石穴下殺了兒女。<br>Who inflame yourselves among the terebinths, Under every flourishing tree, Who slaughter the children in the valleys Under the clefts of the rocks?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>57:6</a></td><td class=td>在穀中光滑石頭裏有你的分；這些就是你所得的分。你也向這些澆了奠祭，獻了素祭；對這些事我豈能寬容呢？<br>Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion, They, yes, they are your lot. Indeed, to them you have poured out a drink offering, You have offered a meal offering. Shall I ease Myself of these?</td></tr>

For apart from Me, you have  uncovered yourself and gone up; You have extended your bed; And you have made an agreement for yourself with them; You loved their bed; you saw their nakedness.</td></tr>

But the wind will carry them all away; A breath will take them away. But he who takes refuge in Me will inherit the land And possess My holy mountain.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>57:16</a></td><td class=td>我必不永遠爭辯，也不長久發怒；因為有靈的，並我所造有氣息的，在我麵前都必發昏。<br>For I will not contend forever, Nor will I always be angry; For the spirit would faint before Me, And the souls which I have made.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>57:17</a></td><td class=td>因他貪得不義之財的罪孽，我就發怒擊打他；我向他掩麵發怒，他卻仍然行走己路，隨心背道。<br>Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry, And I struck him; I hid Myself and was angry; And he went on, turning away in the way of his heart.</td></tr>
