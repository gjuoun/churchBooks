<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>19:2</a></td><td class=td>祂的審判是真實、公義的，因祂審判了那用淫亂敗壞全地的大妓女，並且向她為祂的奴仆伸了流血的冤。<br>For true and righteous are His judgments; for He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and He avenged the blood of His slaves at her hand. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>19:6</a></td><td class=td>我聽見好像大批群眾的聲音，又像眾水的聲音，也像大雷的聲音，說，阿利路亞！因為主我們的神，全能者，作王了。<br>And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>19:7</a></td><td class=td>我們要喜樂歡騰，將榮耀歸與祂；因為羔羊婚娶的時候到了，新婦也自己預備好了。<br>Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>19:8</a></td><td class=td>又賜她得穿明亮潔淨的細麻衣，這細麻衣就是聖徒所行的義。<br>And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>19:10</a></td><td class=td>我就俯伏在他腳前要拜他。他說，千萬不可。我和你並你那些持守耶穌見證的弟兄，同是作奴仆的；你要敬拜神！因為耶穌的見證乃是預言的靈。<br>And I fell before his feet to worship him. And he said to me, Do not do this. I am your fellow slave and a fellow slave of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>19:11</a></td><td class=td>我看見天開了，並且看哪，有一匹白馬，騎在馬上的，稱為忠信真實，祂審判、爭戰都憑著公義。<br>And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. </td></tr>
