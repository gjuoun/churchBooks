<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>19:4</a></td><td class=td>祂就回答說，難道你們沒有念過，那起初造人的，是造男造女，<br>And He answered and said, Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>19:5</a></td><td class=td>並且說，“為這緣故，人要離開父母，與妻子聯合，二人成為一體”麼？<br>And said, "For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh''? </td></tr>
