<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>7:1</a></td><td class=td>以色列人在當滅的物上犯了不忠實的罪，因為猶大支派中，謝拉的曾孫，撒底的孫子，迦米的兒子亞幹取了當滅的物；耶和華的怒氣就向以色列人發作。<br>But the children of Israel acted unfaithfully in that which was devoted to destruction, for Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of that which was devoted to destruction; and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the children of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>7:2</a></td><td class=td>約書亞從耶利哥打發人往伯特利東邊，靠近伯亞文的艾城去；他對他們說，你們上去窺探那地。那些人就上去窺探艾城。<br>Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, east of Bethel; and he spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. So the men went up and spied out Ai.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>7:3</a></td><td class=td>他們回到約書亞那裏，對他說，眾民不必都上去，大約二三千人上去就能攻下艾城；不必勞累眾民都去，因為那裏的人少。<br>And they returned to Joshua and said to him, Not all the people need go up; let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Do not make all the people labor there, for the  enemies are few.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>7:4</a></td><td class=td>於是民中約有三千人上那裏去，竟在艾城的人麵前逃跑了。<br>So about three thousand men from the people went up there, but they fled before the men of Ai.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>7:5</a></td><td class=td>艾城的人擊殺了他們約三十六人，從城門前追趕他們，直到示巴琳，在下坡擊敗他們；眾民的心就融化如水。<br>And the men of Ai struck some of them, about thirty-six men; and they pursued them from before the gate unto Shebarim and struck them on the slope. And the heart of the people melted and became like water.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>7:6</a></td><td class=td>約書亞便撕裂衣服，他和以色列的長老在耶和華的約櫃前，麵伏於地，直到晚上；他們也把塵土撒在頭上。<br>And Joshua rent his clothes and fell to the ground upon his face before the Ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>7:7</a></td><td class=td>約書亞說，哀哉！主耶和華阿，你為什麼竟領這百姓過約但河，將我們交在亞摩利人的手中，使我們滅亡呢？我們不如住在約但河那邊倒好。<br>And Joshua said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all? To give us over into the hand of the Amorites and cause us to perish? If only we had been content to dwell across the Jordan!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>7:8</a></td><td class=td>主阿，以色列人既在仇敵麵前轉背逃跑，我還有什麼可說的呢？<br>Oh, Lord, what can I say after Israel has turned its back before its enemies?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>7:9</a></td><td class=td>迦南人和這地一切的居民聽見了，就必圍困我們，將我們的名從地上剪除。那時你為你的大名要怎樣行呢？<br>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>7:10</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對約書亞說，起來，你為何這樣麵伏於地？<br>Then Jehovah said to Joshua, Rise up! Why have you fallen upon your face?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>7:11</a></td><td class=td>以色列人犯了罪，違背了我所吩咐他們的約，取了當滅的物；又偷竊，又行詭詐，又把那當滅的物放在他們的物件中。<br>Israel has sinned. Indeed they have trespassed My covenant, which I commanded them; indeed they have taken of that which was devoted to destruction; indeed they have stolen; indeed they have been deceptive; indeed they have put it among their goods.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>7:12</a></td><td class=td>因此，以色列人在仇敵麵前站立不住；他們在仇敵麵前轉背逃跑，是因成了當滅的；你們若不把當滅的物從你們中間毀掉，我就不再與你們同在了。<br>Thus the children of Israel are not able to stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, for they have become something devoted to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy that which was devoted to destruction from among you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>7:13</a></td><td class=td>你起來，叫百姓分別為聖，說，你們要使自己分別為聖，豫備明天，因為耶和華以色列的神這樣說，以色列阿，你們中間有當滅的物，非等到你們把那當滅的物從你們中間除掉，你們在仇敵麵前必站立不住。<br>Rise up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, There is something devoted to destruction among you, O Israel; you will not be able to stand before your enemies until you remove that which was devoted to destruction from among you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>7:14</a></td><td class=td>到了早晨，你們要按著支派近前來；耶和華所取的支派，要按著家族近前來；耶和華所取的家族，要按著家室近前來；耶和華所取的家室，要按著男丁，一個一個的近前來。<br>Therefore in the morning you shall be brought near by your tribes; and the tribe which Jehovah takes shall draw near family by family; and the family which Jehovah takes shall draw near house by house; and the house which Jehovah takes shall draw near warrior by warrior.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>7:15</a></td><td class=td>被取的人有當滅的物在他那裏，他和他所有的必被火焚燒；因他違背了耶和華的約，又因他在以色列中行了愚妄的事。<br>And he who is taken with that which was devoted to destruction shall be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has trespassed the covenant of Jehovah and because he has committed folly in Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>7:16</a></td><td class=td>於是約書亞清早起來，使以色列人按著支派近前來，取出來的是猶大支派；<br>So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>7:17</a></td><td class=td>他使猶大支派近前來，就取了謝拉家族；使謝拉家族，按著男丁，一個一個的近前來，取出來的是撒底；<br>And he brought the family of Judah near, and the family of the Zerahites was taken. And he brought the family of the Zerahites near warrior by warrior, and Zabdi was taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>7:18</a></td><td class=td>使撒底的家室，按著男丁，一個一個的近前來，就取出猶大支派的人謝拉的曾孫，撒底的孫子，迦米的兒子亞幹。<br>And he brought the  house of Zabdi near warrior by warrior, and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>7:19</a></td><td class=td>約書亞對亞幹說，我兒，我勸你將榮耀歸給耶和華以色列的神，向祂認罪，將你所作的事告訴我，不要向我隱瞞。<br>And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give glory to Jehovah the God of Israel, and  make confession to Him. And tell me what you have done; do not hide anything from me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>7:20</a></td><td class=td>亞幹回答約書亞說，我實在得罪了耶和華以色列的神。我所作的事是這樣：<br>Then Achan answered Joshua and said, It is true; I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel; and this is what I did:</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>7:21</a></td><td class=td>我在所奪的財物中，看見一件美好的示拿衣服、二百舍客勒銀子、一條金子重五十舍客勒，我貪圖這些物件，便拿去了。這些物件現今藏在我帳棚內的地裏，銀子在衣服底下。<br>When I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle of Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. And now they are hidden in the earth in my tent, with the silver under it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>7:22</a></td><td class=td>約書亞就打發使者跑到亞幹的帳棚裏。那件衣服果然藏在他帳棚內，銀子在底下。<br>And Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. And there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>7:23</a></td><td class=td>他們就把那些物件從帳棚裏取出來，拿到約書亞和以色列眾人那裏，擺在耶和華麵前。<br>And they took the things from within the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel, and spread them out before Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>7:24</a></td><td class=td>約書亞和以色列眾人把謝拉的曾孫亞幹和那銀子、那件衣服、那條金子，並亞幹的兒子、女兒、牛、驢、羊、帳棚、以及他所有的，都帶上亞割穀去。<br>Then Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah and the silver and the mantle and the wedge of gold, and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his donkeys and his sheep and his tent and all that he had; and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>7:25</a></td><td class=td>約書亞說，你為什麼叫我們遭禍呢？今日耶和華必叫你遭禍。於是以色列眾人用石頭打死他和他所有的，並將這一切用火焚燒。<br>And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? Jehovah will trouble you this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire when they had stoned them with stones.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>7:26</a></td><td class=td>眾人在亞幹身上堆成一大堆石頭，直存到今日。於是耶和華轉意，不發祂的烈怒。因此那地方名叫亞割穀，直到今日。<br>Then they erected over him a great heap of stones, which is there to this day; and Jehovah turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor to this day.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
