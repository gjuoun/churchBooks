<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>23:1</a></td><td class=td>保羅定睛看著議會，說，諸位，弟兄們，我在神麵前行事為人都是憑著無虧的良心，直到今日。<br>And Paul, looking intently at the Sanhedrin, said, Men, brothers, I have conducted myself in all good conscience before God until this day. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>23:2</a></td><td class=td>大祭司亞拿尼亞就吩咐旁邊站著的人打他的嘴。<br>And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>23:3</a></td><td class=td>保羅對他說，你這粉飾的牆，神將要擊打你了。你坐堂是要按律法審問我，你竟違背律法，吩咐人打我麼？<br>Then Paul said to him, God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall. And do you sit to judge me according to the law, and contrary to the law you order me to be struck? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>23:4</a></td><td class=td>站在旁邊的人說，你辱罵神的大祭司麼？<br>And those standing by said, Do you revile the high priest of God? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>23:5</a></td><td class=td>保羅說，弟兄們，我不曉得他是大祭司；經上記著，“不可毀謗你百姓的官長。”<br>And Paul said, I did not know, brothers, that he is the high priest; for it is written, "You shall not speak evilly of the ruler of your people.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>23:6</a></td><td class=td>保羅看出其中一部分是撒都該人，另一部分是法利賽人，就在議會中喊著說，諸位，弟兄們，我是法利賽人，是法利賽人的子孫；我現在受審問，是為了盼望死人複活。<br>And Paul, knowing that one part was Sadducees and the other Pharisees, cried out in the Sanhedrin, Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged! </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>23:7</a></td><td class=td>他說了這話，法利賽人和撒都該人便起了爭執，會眾就分裂了。<br>And when he spoke this, a dissension took place between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the multitude was divided. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>23:8</a></td><td class=td>因為撒都該人說沒有複活，也沒有天使和靈；法利賽人卻樣樣都承認。<br>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>23:9</a></td><td class=td>於是大大的喧嚷起來，有幾個法利賽派的經學家站起來爭辯說，我們在這人身上看不出什麼惡來，說不定有靈或天使對他說過話。<br>And there was a great outcry; and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party rose up and contended, saying, We find nothing evil in this man. And what if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>23:10</a></td><td class=td>那時大起紛爭，千夫長恐怕保羅被他們扯碎了，就吩咐兵丁下去，把他從眾人當中搶出來，帶進營樓去。<br>And when much dissension had taken place, the commander, fearing that Paul might be torn to pieces by them, ordered the detachment of soldiers to go down and seize him from their midst and bring him into the barracks. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>23:11</a></td><td class=td>當夜，主站在保羅旁邊說，你當壯膽，你怎樣在耶路撒冷鄭重的為我作了見證，也必照樣在羅馬為我作見證。<br>But in the night following, the Lord stood by him and said, Take courage, for as you have solemnly testified to the things concerning Me in Jerusalem, so also you must testify in Rome. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>23:12</a></td><td class=td>到了天亮，猶太人就團結同謀，發咒起誓說，若不先殺保羅，就不吃不喝。<br>And when it became day, the Jews formed a plot and put themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>23:13</a></td><td class=td>一同起誓訂這陰謀的，有四十多人。<br>And there were more than forty who swore to this conspiracy. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>23:14</a></td><td class=td>他們來到祭司長和長老跟前，說，我們已經厲害的發咒起誓，若不先殺保羅，就不吃什麼。<br>They came to the chief priests and the elders and said, We have bound ourselves with a curse to taste nothing until we kill Paul. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>23:15</a></td><td class=td>現在你們連同議會要通知千夫長，叫他帶保羅下到你們這裏來，假作要更詳確審斷他的事；我們已經預備好了，不等他走近，就殺掉他。<br>Now therefore you, with the Sanhedrin, notify the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine more accurately the things concerning him; and we, before he draws near, are ready to do away with him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>23:16</a></td><td class=td>保羅的外甥聽見這埋伏的事，就來，進了營樓，告訴保羅。<br>But the son of Paul's sister heard of the ambush, and he came and entered into the barracks and reported it to Paul. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>23:17</a></td><td class=td>保羅請一個百夫長來，說，你帶這青年人到千夫長那裏，他有事要告訴他。<br>And Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, Bring this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>23:18</a></td><td class=td>於是百夫長拉著他，帶到千夫長那裏，說，被囚的保羅請我到他那裏，求我帶這青年人到你這裏，他有事要告訴你。<br>So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, The prisoner Paul called me to him and asked me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to tell you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>23:19</a></td><td class=td>千夫長就拉著他的手走到一旁，私下查問說，你有什麼事要告訴我？<br>And the commander took him by the hand and, withdrawing privately, inquired, What is it that you have to report to me? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>23:20</a></td><td class=td>他說，猶太人已經約定，要求你明天帶保羅下到議會裏去，假作要更詳確查問他的事。<br>And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Sanhedrin, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>23:21</a></td><td class=td>你不要聽從他們，因為他們中間有四十多人，埋伏著等待保羅，並且已經發咒起誓，若不先殺保羅，就不吃不喝；現在他們預備好了，隻等你應允。<br>So you should not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him; they have put themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have done away with him. And now they are ready, awaiting the promise from you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>23:22</a></td><td class=td>於是千夫長打發那青年人走，囑咐他說，不要對任何人泄漏，說你將這事通知我了。<br>So the commander dismissed the young man, charging him, Do not tell anyone that you have informed me of these things. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>23:23</a></td><td class=td>千夫長便叫了兩個百夫長來，說，預備步兵二百、馬兵七十、長槍手二百，今夜九時往該撒利亞去。<br>And he called to him a certain two of the centurions and said, Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, as well as seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, by the third hour of the night; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>23:24</a></td><td class=td>也要預備牲口叫保羅騎上，把他平安的護送到總督腓力斯那裏去。<br>And they were also to provide mounts to put Paul on and bring him safely to Felix the governor. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>23:25</a></td><td class=td>千夫長又寫了文書，<br>And he wrote a letter having this form: </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>23:26</a></td><td class=td>大意如下：革老丟呂西亞請總督腓力斯大人安。<br>Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency, Governor Felix, rejoice. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>23:27</a></td><td class=td>這人被猶太人拿住，將要遭害，我得知他是羅馬人，就帶兵丁到場，把他救出來。<br>This man, having been seized by the Jews and about to be done away with by them, I came upon with my detachment of soldiers and rescued, when I learned that he was a Roman. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>23:28</a></td><td class=td>因為想要確知他們告他的緣故，我就帶他下到他們的議會去，<br>And intending to ascertain the cause for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>23:29</a></td><td class=td>便查知他被告，是因他們律法的問題，並沒有什麼該死該綁的罪名。<br>And found him to be accused concerning questions of their law, but having nothing worthy of death or of bonds laid to his charge. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>23:30</a></td><td class=td>後來有人把要害這人的陰謀告訴我，我就立刻解他到你那裏去，又吩咐告他的人，到你麵前告他。<br>And when it was disclosed to me that there was a plot against the man, I sent him at once to you, charging the accusers also to speak the things against him before you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>23:31</a></td><td class=td>於是兵丁照所指示他們的，夜裏將保羅帶到安提帕底。<br>So the soldiers, according to what they had been directed, took up Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>23:32</a></td><td class=td>第二天讓馬兵同保羅前行，他們就回營樓去了。<br>And on the next day, leaving the horsemen to depart with him, they returned to the barracks. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>23:33</a></td><td class=td>馬兵來到該撒利亞，把文書呈給總督，也把保羅帶到他麵前。<br>And when they entered into Caesarea and handed over the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also to him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>23:34</a></td><td class=td>總督念了，就問保羅是那省的人；既查知他是基利家人，<br>And when he had read it, he asked from what province he was; and learning that he was from Cilicia, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>23:35</a></td><td class=td>就說，等告你的人來到，我要細聽你的事。便吩咐人把他看守在希律的王府裏。<br>He said, I will hear your case fully when your accusers also arrive. And he ordered him to be guarded in Herod's praetorium. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
