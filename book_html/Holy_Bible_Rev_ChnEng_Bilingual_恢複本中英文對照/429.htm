<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>3:1</a></td><td class=td>這些事以後，亞哈隨魯王使亞甲族哈米大他的兒子哈曼尊大，抬舉他，叫他位居與他在一起的眾首領之上。<br>After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and he advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>3:2</a></td><td class=td>在王門那裏，王的一切臣仆都跪拜哈曼，因為王曾如此吩咐；惟獨末底改不跪不拜。<br>And all the king's servants who were in the king's gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for so had the king commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>3:3</a></td><td class=td>在王門那裏，王的臣仆問末底改說，你為何違犯王的命令呢？<br>Then the king's servants who were in the king's gate said to Mordecai, Why do you transgress the king's command?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>3:4</a></td><td class=td>他們天天這樣對他說，他還是不聽，他們就告訴哈曼，要看末底改的話站得住站不住，因他已經告訴他們自己是猶大人。<br>And when they had spoken to him day after day and he did not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai's words would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>3:5</a></td><td class=td>哈曼見末底改向他不跪不拜，就怒氣填胸。<br>And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage to him, Haman was filled with rage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>3:6</a></td><td class=td>哈曼不屑隻下手害末底改一人，因他們已將末底改的本族告訴他，所以他想要滅絕亞哈隨魯王通國所有的猶大人，就是末底改的本族。<br>But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who the people of Mordecai were; therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who were throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>3:7</a></td><td class=td>亞哈隨魯王十二年正月，就是尼散月，人在哈曼麵前，按日子和月分掣普珥，就是掣簽，擇定了十二月，就是亞達月。<br>In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day and from month to month, until it fell on the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>3:8</a></td><td class=td>哈曼對亞哈隨魯王說，有一種民散居在王國各省的民中；他們的律例與萬民的律例不同，他們也不遵行王的律例，所以容留他們對王並不妥當。<br>And Haman said to King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples throughout all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws differ from those of all the people, nor do they keep the king's laws. Therefore it is not fitting for the king to let them remain.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>3:9</a></td><td class=td>王若以為美，請下詔滅絕他們；我就稱一萬他連得銀子，交給辦理王事的人，納入王的府庫。<br>If it please the king, let it be decreed in writing that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king's affairs, that they may bring it into the king's treasuries.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>3:10</a></td><td class=td>於是王從自己手上摘下戒指，給猶大人的仇敵亞甲族哈米大他的兒子哈曼。<br>Then the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>3:11</a></td><td class=td>王對哈曼說，這銀子仍賜給你，這民也交給你，你看怎樣好，就怎樣待他們。<br>And the king said to Haman, The silver has been given to you, as well as the people, to do with them as it seems good to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>3:12</a></td><td class=td>正月十三日，王的書記被召來，照著哈曼一切所吩咐的寫了詔書，傳與王的總督、各省的省長、和各族的首領，依照各省的文字達於各省，依照各族的方言達於各族；是奉亞哈隨魯王的名寫的，並且用王的戒指蓋了印。<br>Then the king's scribes were summoned in the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and it was decreed in writing, according to all that Haman commanded, to the king's satraps and to the governors who were over each province and to the princes of every people, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own tongue; in the name of King Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king's signet ring.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>3:13</a></td><td class=td>詔書由驛卒送達王的各省，吩咐要將所有的猶大人，無論老少婦女孩子，在一日之間，在十二月，就是亞達月十三日，全然殲毀，殺戮滅絕，並奪他們的財物為掠物。<br>And letters were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, children and women, in one day, that is, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their spoil.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>3:14</a></td><td class=td>這文書經過抄錄，頒行各省成為法令，向各族宣示，使他們豫備等候那日。<br>A copy of the written decree to be issued as law in all the provinces was published to all the peoples so that they would be ready for that day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>3:15</a></td><td class=td>驛卒奉王的諭旨急忙出發；法令也在書珊京城頒布。王和哈曼坐下飲酒，書珊城卻一片慌亂。<br>The couriers went out, driven in haste by the king's command; and the decree was issued in Susa the capital. And the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was in confusion.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
