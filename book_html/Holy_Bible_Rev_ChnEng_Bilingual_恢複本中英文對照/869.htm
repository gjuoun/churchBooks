<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>7:1</a></td><td class=td>我想醫治以色列的時候，以法蓮的罪孽和撒瑪利亞的惡行就顯露出來；因為他們行事虛謊。內有賊人入室偷竊，外有強盜成群搶劫。<br>When I would heal Israel, Then the iniquity of Ephraim is discovered As well as the evil deeds of Samaria; For they practice falsehood. And the thief comes inside; The band of robbers makes raids outside.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>7:2</a></td><td class=td>他們心裏並不說，我記得他們的一切惡。他們所行的現在纏繞他們，都在我麵前。<br>And they do not say in their hearts That I remember all their evil. Now their doings are all around them; They are before My face.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>7:3</a></td><td class=td>他們以邪惡使君王歡喜，以謊言使首領喜樂。<br>They make the king glad with their evil, And the princes, with their lies.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>7:4</a></td><td class=td>他們都是行奸淫的，像火爐被烤餅者燒熱：從摶麵到發麵的時候，他暫不使火發旺。<br>All of them practice adultery; They are like an oven heated by the baker: He ceases from stirring the fire, After kneading the dough, until it is leavened.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>7:5</a></td><td class=td>在我們王宴樂的日子，首領因酒的烈性成病；王與褻慢人拉手。<br>On the feast day of our king The princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; He stretched out his hand with scorners.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>7:6</a></td><td class=td>他們埋伏的時候，心中熱如火爐：就如烤餅者整夜睡臥，到了早晨，火爐燒旺，火氣炎炎。<br>For they have made their heart  ready Like an oven while they lie in  wait: All night long Their baker sleeps, But in the morning the  oven burns Like a flaming fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>7:7</a></td><td class=td>眾人也熱如火爐，吞滅他們的審判官；他們的君王都仆倒而死；他們中間無一人呼求我。<br>All of them are hot like an oven, And they devour their judges; All their kings fall; There is no one among them who calls on Me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>7:8</a></td><td class=td>以法蓮與列邦人攙雜；以法蓮是沒有翻過的餅。<br>Ephraim-among the peoples He mixes himself; Ephraim is a cake Not turned.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>7:9</a></td><td class=td>外邦人吞吃他力量得來的，他自己卻不知道；滿頭白發，他自己也不曉得。<br>Strangers have devoured his  strength, And he himself does not know it; Indeed gray hairs are  all over him, And he himself does not know it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>7:10</a></td><td class=td>以色列的驕傲當麵見證自己；雖遭遇這一切，他們仍不歸向耶和華他們的神，也不尋求祂。<br>And the pride of Israel testifies to his face; Yet they have not returned to Jehovah their God, And they have not sought Him,  because of all this.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>7:11</a></td><td class=td>以法蓮好像鴿子愚蠢無知：他們呼求埃及，投奔亞述。<br>And Ephraim has become like a silly dove Without  understanding: They call to Egypt; They go to Assyria.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>7:12</a></td><td class=td>他們去的時候，我必將我的網撒在他們身上；我要打下他們，如同空中的鳥；我必按他們會眾所聽見的，管教他們。<br>When they go, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like the birds of heaven; I will chasten them according to the report given to their assembly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>7:13</a></td><td class=td>他們有禍了！因他們飄離了我。他們必遭毀滅，因他們違背我。我雖要救贖他們，他們卻向我說謊。<br>Woe to them! For they have wandered from Me. Devastation to them! For they have transgressed against Me. And I would have redeemed them, But they have spoken lies against Me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>7:14</a></td><td class=td>他們心中並不哀求我，乃在床上呼號。他們為求五穀新酒聚集，仍然悖逆我。<br>And they did not cry unto Me in their heart When they howled in their beds. For grain and new wine they assemble themselves; They rebel against Me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>7:15</a></td><td class=td>我雖訓練他們，堅固他們的膀臂，他們竟圖謀惡事抗拒我。<br>Though I trained them and  strengthened their arms, They devise evil against Me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>7:16</a></td><td class=td>他們歸向，卻不歸向至上者；他們如同詭詐的弓。他們的首領，必因舌頭的狂傲倒在刀下。這在埃及地必為人所譏笑。<br>They return, but not to Him who is on high; They are like a deceitful bow. Their princes will fall by the sword Because of the rage of their tongue. This will be their derision In the land of Egypt.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
