<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>4:1</a></td><td class=td>末後的日子，耶和華殿的山必堅立於諸山之頂，高舉過於眾岡陵；萬民都要湧向這山。<br>But in the last days The mountain of the house of Jehovah Will be established on the top of the mountains; And it will be lifted up among the hills; And the peoples will stream to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>4:2</a></td><td class=td>必有許多國的民前來，說，來罷，我們登耶和華的山，上雅各神的殿；祂必將祂的道路教導我們，使我們行祂的路徑；因為訓誨必出於錫安，耶和華的言語必出於耶路撒冷。<br>And many nations will come and say, Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah And to the house of the God of Jacob; That He may instruct us in His ways, And that we may walk in His  paths; For from Zion will go forth instruction, And the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>4:3</a></td><td class=td>祂必在多族的民中施行審判，為遠方許多的國斷定是非。他們要將刀打成犁頭，把槍打成鐮刀；這國不舉刀攻擊那國，他們也不再學習戰事。<br>And He will judge between many peoples And will decide matters for numerous nations from afar. And they will beat their swords into plowshares And their spears into pruning knives; Nation will not lift up sword against nation, Nor will they learn war anymore.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>4:4</a></td><td class=td>人人都要坐在自己葡萄樹下和無花果樹下，無人驚擾；因為萬軍之耶和華已經親口說了。<br>And they will each sit underneath his vine And underneath his fig tree, And no one will disturb them; For the mouth of Jehovah of hosts has spoken.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>4:5</a></td><td class=td>萬民各奉自己神的名而行；我們卻奉耶和華我們神的名而行，直到永永遠遠。<br>For all the peoples will walk, Each in the name of his god; But we will walk In the name of Jehovah our God Forever and ever.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>4:7</a></td><td class=td>我必使瘸腿的成為餘剩之民，使那被趕到遠方的成為強盛之國；耶和華要在錫安山作王治理他們，從今直到永遠。<br>And I will make her that limps a remnant, And her that has been cast far away a mighty nation; And Jehovah will reign over them in Mount Zion From then on, and even forever.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>4:10</a></td><td class=td>錫安的女子阿，你要疼痛劬勞，仿佛生產的婦人；因為你必從城裏出來，住在田野，且要到巴比倫去。在那裏你要蒙解救，在那裏耶和華必救贖你脫離仇敵的手。<br>Suffer the pain and thrust forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman delivering a child. For now you will go forth from the city And dwell in the field; And you will go into Babylon. And there you will be delivered; There Jehovah will redeem you From the hand of your enemies.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>4:12</a></td><td class=td>他們卻不知道耶和華的意念，也不明白祂的籌畫；祂聚集他們，好像把禾捆聚到禾場一樣。<br>But they do not know The thoughts of Jehovah, And they do not understand His counsel; For He has gathered them like sheaves for the threshing floor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>4:13</a></td><td class=td>錫安的女子阿，起來踹穀罷；我必使你的角成為鐵，使你的蹄成為銅。你必將多族打得粉碎；我必將他們的財利獻與耶和華，將他們的貲財獻與全地的主。<br>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; For I will make your horn iron, And I will make your hooves bronze; And you will crush many peoples to powder. And I will devote their profit to Jehovah, And their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
