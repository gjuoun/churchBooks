<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>3:1</a></td><td class=td>你們看，父賜給我們的是何等的愛，使我們得稱為神的兒女，我們也真是祂的兒女。世人所以不認識我們，是因未曾認識祂。<br>Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are. Because of this the world does not know us, because it did not know Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>3:2</a></td><td class=td>親愛的，我們現在是神的兒女，將來如何，還未顯明；但我們曉得祂若顯現，我們必要像祂；因為我們必要看見祂，正如祂所是的。<br>Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we will be. We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>3:3</a></td><td class=td>凡向祂有這盼望的，就潔淨自己，正如祂是潔淨的一樣。<br>And everyone who has this hope set on Him purifies himself, even as He is pure. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>3:4</a></td><td class=td>凡犯罪的，也行不法；罪就是不法。<br>Everyone who practices sin practices lawlessness also, and sin is lawlessness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>3:5</a></td><td class=td>你們曉得祂曾顯現，為要除去罪；在祂裏麵並沒有罪。<br>And you know that He was manifested that He might take away sins; and sin is not in Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>3:6</a></td><td class=td>凡住在祂裏麵的，就不犯罪；凡犯罪的，是未曾看見祂，也未曾認識祂。<br>Everyone who abides in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has not seen Him or known Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>3:7</a></td><td class=td>孩子們，不要讓人迷惑你們，行義的人才是義的，正如祂是義的一樣；<br>Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who practices righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>3:8</a></td><td class=td>犯罪的是出於魔鬼，因為魔鬼從起初就犯罪。為此，神的兒子顯現出來，是要消除魔鬼的作為。<br>He who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>3:9</a></td><td class=td>凡從神生的，就不犯罪，因為神的種子住在他裏麵；他也不能犯罪，因為他是從神生的。<br>Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>3:23</a></td><td class=td>神的誡命就是叫我們信祂兒子耶穌基督的名，並且照祂所賜給我們的誡命彼此相愛。<br>And this is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, even as He gave a commandment to us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>3:24</a></td><td class=td>遵守神誡命的，就住在神裏麵，神也住在他裏麵。在此我們就知道神住在我們裏麵，乃是由於祂所賜給我們的那靈。<br>And he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him.
