<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>4:1</a></td><td class=td>這樣，我們可說我們的祖宗亞伯拉罕照著肉體得了什麼？<br>What then shall we say that Abraham our forefather according to the flesh has found? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>4:2</a></td><td class=td>倘若亞伯拉罕是本於行為得稱義，就有可誇的，隻是在神麵前並無可誇。<br>For if Abraham was justified out of works, he has something to boast in, but not before God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>4:3</a></td><td class=td>原來經上說什麼？說，“亞伯拉罕信神，這就算為他的義。”<br>For what does the Scripture say? "And Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>4:4</a></td><td class=td>作工的得工價，不是照著恩典，乃是照著所該得者算的。<br>Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>4:5</a></td><td class=td>惟有不作工，隻信靠那稱不虔者為義之神的，他的信就算為他的義。<br>But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>4:6</a></td><td class=td>正如大衛也稱那在行為以外，蒙神算為義的人為有福的：<br>Even as David also speaks blessing on the man to whom God accounts righteousness apart from works: </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>4:7</a></td><td class=td>“不法得赦免，罪得遮蓋的人，是有福的。<br>"Blessed are they whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered over. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>4:8</a></td><td class=td>主絕不算為有罪的人，是有福的。”<br>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord shall by no means account sin.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>4:9</a></td><td class=td>如此，這稱為有福的福是單加給受割禮的人，還是也加給未受割禮的人？因我們說，亞伯拉罕的信，就算為他的義，<br>Is this blessing then upon the circumcision only, or also upon the uncircumcision? For we say, Faith was accounted to Abraham as righteousness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>4:10</a></td><td class=td>是怎麼算的？是在他受割禮的時候，還是在他未受割禮的時候？不是在受割禮的時候，乃是在未受割禮的時候。<br>How then was it accounted? While he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>4:11</a></td><td class=td>並且他受了割禮的記號，作他未受割禮時那信之義的印記，叫他作一切未受割禮而信之人的父，使他們也算為義；<br>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those in uncircumcision who believe, that righteousness might be accounted to them also, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>4:12</a></td><td class=td>又作受割禮之人的父，就是那些不但受割禮，並且照我們祖宗亞伯拉罕，未受割禮時之信的腳蹤而行的人。<br>And the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>4:13</a></td><td class=td>因為神應許亞伯拉罕，或他的後裔，必得承受世界，不是藉著律法，乃是藉著信的義。<br>For it was not through the law that the promise was made to Abraham or to his seed that he would be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>4:14</a></td><td class=td>若是本於律法的，才得為後嗣，信就成了虛空，應許也就失效了。<br>For if those of the law are heirs, faith has been made void and the promise has been annulled; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>4:15</a></td><td class=td>因為律法是惹動忿怒的；那裏沒有律法，那裏就沒有過犯。<br>For the law works out wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>4:16</a></td><td class=td>所以人得為後嗣是本於信，為要照著恩，使應許定然歸給一切後裔，不但歸給那本於律法的，也歸給那本於亞伯拉罕之信的。<br>Therefore the inheritance is out of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise may be certain to all the seed, not to that which is of the law only, but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>4:17</a></td><td class=td>亞伯拉罕在他所信那叫死人複活，又稱無為有的神麵前，是我們眾人的父，如經上所記：“我已經立你作多國的父。”<br>(As it is written, "I have appointed you a father of many nations'') in the sight of God whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>4:18</a></td><td class=td>他在無可指望的時候，仍靠指望而信，就得以照先前所說，“你的後裔將要如此”的話，作多國的父。<br>He beyond hope believed in hope in order that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, "So shall your seed be.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>4:19</a></td><td class=td>他將近百歲的時候，雖然想到自己的身體如同已死，撒拉的生育也已斷絕，他的信還是不軟弱，<br>And not weakening in his faith, he considered his own body as already dead, being about a hundred years old, as well as the deadening of Sarah's womb; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>4:20</a></td><td class=td>總沒有因不信而疑惑神的應許，反倒因信得著加力，將榮耀歸與神，<br>But with regard to the promise of God, he did not doubt in unbelief, but was empowered by faith, giving glory to God </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>4:21</a></td><td class=td>且滿心確信，神所應許的，祂也必能作成；<br>And being fully persuaded that what He had promised He was able also to do. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>4:22</a></td><td class=td>所以這就算為他的義。<br>Therefore also it was accounted to him as righteousness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>4:23</a></td><td class=td>算為他的義這句話，不是單為他寫的，<br>Now it was not written for his sake only that it was accounted to him, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>4:24</a></td><td class=td>也是為我們將來得算為義的人，就是為我們這些信靠那使我們的主耶穌從死人中複活者的人寫的。<br>But for ours also to whom it is to be accounted, who believe on Him who has raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>4:25</a></td><td class=td>耶穌被交給人是為我們的過犯，複活是為我們的稱義。<br>Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
