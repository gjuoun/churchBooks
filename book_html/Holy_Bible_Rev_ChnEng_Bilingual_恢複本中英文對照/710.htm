<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>31:1</a></td><td class=td>禍哉，那些下埃及求幫助的；他們仗賴馬匹，倚靠眾多的車輛，並倚靠極其強壯的馬兵，卻不仰望以色列的聖者，也不求問耶和華！<br>Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help; They rely on horses And trust in chariots because they are many And in horsemen because they are very strong; But they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, Nor seek Jehovah!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>31:2</a></td><td class=td>其實耶和華也有智慧；祂必降災禍，並不收回自己的話，卻要興起攻擊那作惡之家，又攻擊那幫助作孽之人的。<br>But He also is wise and will bring ill upon them; And He does not turn back His words, But will rise up against the house of evildoers And against the help of the workers of iniquity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>31:3</a></td><td class=td>埃及人不過是人，並不是神；他們的馬不過是血肉，並不是靈；耶和華一伸手，那幫助人的必絆跌，那受幫助的也必仆倒，都一同滅亡。<br>The Egyptians are mere men and not God, And their horses are mere flesh and not spirit; Thus Jehovah will stretch out His hand, And he who helps will stumble and he who is helped will fall, And all of them will be consumed together.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>31:4</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對我如此說：獅子和少壯獅子獲食咆哮，就是喊許多牧人來攻擊牠，牠總不因他們的聲音驚惶，也不因他們的喧嘩縮伏；萬軍之耶和華也必如此降臨在錫安山及其岡陵上爭戰。<br>For Jehovah has spoken thus to me, As the lion or the lion cub Roars over its prey And because of it a crowd of shepherds Is called out, But it is not frightened by their voice, Nor overcome by their noise; So Jehovah of hosts will descend To wage war on Mount Zion and on its hill.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>31:5</a></td><td class=td>雀鳥怎樣扇翅覆雛，萬軍之耶和華也要照樣保護耶路撒冷；祂必保護且拯救、逾越且保全。<br>Like flying birds So Jehovah of hosts will protect Jerusalem; He will protect and deliver it; He will pass over and rescue it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>31:6</a></td><td class=td>以色列人哪，你們要歸向祂，就是你們所深深悖逆的那位。<br>Return to Him from whom men have deeply revolted, O children of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>31:7</a></td><td class=td>到那日，各人必將自己的銀偶像和金偶像，就是你們親手為自己所造的罪，都拋棄了。<br>For in that day each man will cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you as a sin.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>31:8</a></td><td class=td>亞述人必倒在刀下，並非人的刀；有刀要將他吞滅，並非人的刀。他必逃避刀劍，他的少年人必成為服苦役的。<br>And the Assyrian will fall by the sword not of a man, And the sword not of man will devour him. Thus he will flee from a sword, And his young men will be forced into labor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>31:9</a></td><td class=td>他的磐石必因驚嚇挪去，他的首領必因旌旗驚惶；這是那有火在錫安、有爐在耶路撒冷的耶和華說的。<br>And his rock will pass away in terror, And his princes will be dismayed by the standard, Declares Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion And whose furnace is in Jerusalem.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
