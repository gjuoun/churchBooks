<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>1:2</a></td><td class=td>一日，亞哈謝從撒瑪利亞王宮樓上的窗戶掉下來，就病了；於是差遣使者，說，你們去問以革倫的神巴力西卜，我這病能好不能好。<br>And Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber which was in Samaria and became ill. And he sent messengers and said to them, Go and inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I will recover from this sickness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>1:3</a></td><td class=td>但耶和華的使者對提斯比人以利亞說，你起來，上去迎著撒瑪利亞王的使者，對他們說，你們去問以革倫神巴力西卜，豈因以色列中沒有神麼？<br>But the Angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise; go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>1:4</a></td><td class=td>所以耶和華如此說，你必不下你所上的床，必定要死。以利亞就去了。<br>Now therefore thus says Jehovah, You shall not come down from the bed on which you have gone up, but you shall surely die. And Elijah departed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>1:5</a></td><td class=td>使者回來見王，王問他們說，你們為什麼回來？<br>And when the messengers returned to him, he said to them, Why have you returned?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>1:6</a></td><td class=td>使者對他說，有一個人上來迎著我們，對我們說，去罷，你們回去見差你們來的王，對他說，耶和華如此說，你差人去問以革倫神巴力西卜，豈因以色列中沒有神麼？所以你必不下你所上的床，必定要死。<br>And they said to him, A man came up to meet us and said to us, Go and return to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you send men to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed on which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>1:7</a></td><td class=td>王問他們說，那上來迎著你們，告訴你們這話的，是怎樣的人？<br>And he said to them, What sort of man was he who came up to meet you and spoke these words to you?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>1:8</a></td><td class=td>他們說，他身穿毛衣，腰束皮帶。王說，這是提斯比人以利亞。<br>And they said to him, A hairy man, and he was girded with a leather girdle around his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>1:9</a></td><td class=td> 於是王差遣一個五十夫長，帶著他那五十人去見以利亞。他上到以利亞那裏，以利亞正坐在山頂上。五十夫長對他說，神人哪，王說，你下來！<br>And he sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. And the captain went up to him, and there he was, sitting on the top of the hill. And he said to him, O man of God, the king says, Come down!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>1:10</a></td><td class=td>以利亞回答五十夫長說，我若是神人，願火從天上降下來，燒滅你和你那五十人。<br>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty. Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>1:11</a></td><td class=td>於是有火從天上降下來，燒滅五十夫長和他那五十人。王又差遣另一個五十夫長，帶著他那五十人去見以利亞。五十夫長對以利亞說，神人哪，王如此說，你快快下來。<br>And again the king sent another captain of fifty with his fifty.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>1:12</a></td><td class=td>以利亞回答他們說，我若是神人，願火從天上降下來，燒滅你和你那五十人。<br>And Elijah answered and said to them, If I am the man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>1:13</a></td><td class=td>於是神的火從天上降下來，燒滅五十夫長和他那五十人。王又差遣第三個五十夫長，帶著他那五十人去。這五十夫長上去，一來到就雙膝跪在以利亞麵前，懇求他說，神人哪，願我的性命和你這五十個仆人的性命，在你眼中看為寶貴。<br>And again the king sent a captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up; and he came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and he entreated him and said to him, O man of God, may my soul and the soul of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>1:14</a></td><td class=td>已經有火從天上降下來，燒滅先前那兩個五十夫長，和他們各自帶的五十人；現在願我的性命在你眼中看為寶貴。<br>Already fire has come down from heaven and consumed the first two captains of fifty and their fifties; and now may my soul be precious in your sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>1:15</a></td><td class=td>耶和華的使者對以利亞說，你同著他下去，不要怕他。以利亞就起來，同著他下去見王。<br>And the Angel of Jehovah said to Elijah, Go down with him; do not be afraid of him. And he rose up and went down with him to the king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>1:16</a></td><td class=td>以利亞對王說，耶和華如此說，你差人去問以革倫神巴力西卜，豈因以色列中沒有神可以求祂的話麼？所以你必不下你所上的床，必定要死。<br>Then he said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Because you sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron-was it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word?-therefore you shall not come down from the bed on which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>1:17</a></td><td class=td>亞哈謝果然死了，正如以利亞所說耶和華的話。因他沒有兒子，他兄弟約蘭接替他作王，正在猶大王約沙法的兒子約蘭第二年。<br>And he died according to the word of Jehovah which Elijah had spoken.
