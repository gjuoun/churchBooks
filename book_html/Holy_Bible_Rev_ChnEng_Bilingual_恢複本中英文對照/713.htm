<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>34:1</a></td><td class=td>列國阿，要近前來聽；眾民哪，要留心聽！地和其上所充滿的，世界和其中所出的一切，都應當聽。<br>Draw near, O nations, to hear; And listen, O peoples! Let the earth and all that fills it hear, The world and all that springs forth from it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>34:2</a></td><td class=td>因為耶和華的忿怒臨到萬國，祂的烈怒臨到他們的全軍；祂已將他們滅盡，交出他們受殺戮。<br>For Jehovah's indignation is upon all the nations, And His wrath is upon all their armies; He has utterly destroyed them; He has delivered them unto the slaughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>34:3</a></td><td class=td>他們被殺的必被拋棄，屍首臭氣上騰；諸山被他們的血融化。<br>Thus their slain are cast away, And from their corpses their stench will come up; And the mountains will be melted with their blood.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>34:4</a></td><td class=td>天上的萬象都要消沒，天要卷起好像書卷，其上的萬象都要衰敗，像葡萄樹的葉子凋殘，又像無花果樹的葉子凋殘。<br>And all the armies of heaven will be dissolved, And the heavens will be rolled up like a scroll, And all their host will wither away, As the leaf withers from the vine, Or like a leaf withering from the fig tree.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>34:5</a></td><td class=td>因為我的刀在天上已經喝足；看哪，這刀必落在以東和我所要滅盡的民身上，施行審判。<br>For My sword has drunk its fill in heaven. Now it will descend in judgment upon Edom And upon the people whom I have devoted to judgment.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>34:6</a></td><td class=td>耶和華的刀滿了血，是用脂油、用羊羔和公山羊的血、並用公綿羊腰子的脂油滋潤的；因為耶和華在波斯拉有獻祭的事，在以東地大行殺戮。<br>Jehovah's sword is full of blood; It has fattened itself with fat, With the blood of lambs and goats, With the fat of the kidneys of rams; For Jehovah has a sacrifice in Bozrah And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>34:7</a></td><td class=td>野牛、牛犢、和公牛要一同下來；他們的地要喝足血，他們的塵土要因脂油肥潤。<br>Wild oxen will also go down with them, The young bulls with the bulls; And their land will drink its fill of their blood, And their dust will become fat with their fat.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>34:8</a></td><td class=td>因耶和華有報仇之日，為錫安的爭辯，有報應之年。<br>For Jehovah has a day of vengeance, A year of recompense for Zion's contention.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>34:9</a></td><td class=td>以東的河水要變為柏油，塵埃要變為硫磺，地土要成為燒著的柏油。<br>And its streams will be turned into pitch, And its dust into brimstone; And its land will become burning pitch.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>34:10</a></td><td class=td>晝夜總不熄滅，煙氣永遠上騰；必世世代代成為荒涼，永永遠遠無人經過。<br>It will not be quenched by night or by day; Its smoke will go up forever; It will be desolate from generation to generation; No one will pass through it forever and ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>34:11</a></td><td class=td>鵜鶘和箭豬卻要得為業，貓頭鷹和烏鴉要住在其間；耶和華必將荒廢的準繩和空虛的線鉈拉在其上。<br>But the pelican and the porcupine will inherit it, And the owl and the raven will dwell in it; And He will stretch over it The line of nothingness and the plummet weights of emptiness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>34:12</a></td><td class=td>以東人要召貴胄來治國，那裏卻無一個，首領也都歸於無有。<br>As for its nobles, there is no one there whom they may call to assume the kingdom, And all its princes will be nothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>34:13</a></td><td class=td>以東的宮堡要長荊棘，堅固城要長刺草和蒺藜；以東要作野狗的住處、鴕鳥的居所。<br>And thorns will come up in its citadels, Nettles and thistles in its fortified cities; And it will be a habitation for jackals, And an abode for ostriches.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>34:14</a></td><td class=td>曠野的走獸要和豺狼相遇；野山羊要與伴偶對叫；連夜間的怪物也在那裏棲身，為自己找著安歇之處。<br>Desert animals will meet with hyenas; And the demon will call to his kind, Indeed there Lilith will settle  And find a resting place for herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>34:15</a></td><td class=td>貓頭鷹要在那裏作窩、下蛋、孵蛋、聚子在其蔭下；鷂鷹也各與伴偶聚集在那裏。<br>There the owl will make its nest and lay eggs, And hatch them and gather them under its protection; Indeed there the vultures will be gathered together, Each with its kind.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>34:16</a></td><td class=td>你們要查考宣讀耶和華的書。這些都無一缺少，無一沒有伴偶，因為祂的口已經吩咐，祂的靈已將牠們聚集。<br>Seek from the book of Jehovah and read.
