<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>5:1</a></td><td class=td>這事以後，到了猶太人的一個節期，耶穌就上耶路撒冷去。<br>After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>5:2</a></td><td class=td>在耶路撒冷靠近羊門有一個池子，希伯來話叫作畢士大，旁邊有五個廊子。<br>Now there is in Jerusalem near the sheepgate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>5:3</a></td><td class=td>裏麵躺著許多病弱的、瞎眼的、瘸腿的、枯幹的，等候水動。<br>In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, waiting for the moving of the water. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>5:4</a></td><td class=td>因為有天使時常下池子攪動那水，水動之後，誰先下去，無論患什麼病，都會痊愈。<br>For an angel went down from time to time in the pool and stirred up the water; the first then to step in after the stirring up of the water was made well of whatever disease he was being held by. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>5:5</a></td><td class=td>在那裏有一個人，病了三十八年。<br>And a certain man was there, who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>5:6</a></td><td class=td>耶穌看見他躺著，知道他已經病了許久，就問他說，你想要痊愈麼？<br>When Jesus saw this one lying there and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition, He said to him, Do you want to get well? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>5:7</a></td><td class=td>病人回答說，先生，水動的時候，沒有人把我放在池子裏；我正去的時候，總有別人比我先下去。<br>The sick man answered Him, Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>5:8</a></td><td class=td>耶穌對他說，起來，拿你的褥子走吧。<br>Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your mat and walk. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>5:9</a></td><td class=td>那人立即痊愈，就拿起褥子走了。<br>And immediately the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>5:10</a></td><td class=td>那天是安息日，所以猶太人對那治好的人說，今天是安息日，你拿褥子是不可的。<br>Therefore the Jews said to the one who had been healed, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your mat. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>5:11</a></td><td class=td>他卻回答說，那使我痊愈的對我說，拿你的褥子走吧。<br>But he answered them, He who made me well, that One said to me, Take up your mat and walk. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>5:12</a></td><td class=td>他們問他說，那對你說拿褥子走的人是誰？<br>They asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your mat and walk? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>5:13</a></td><td class=td>那治好的人不知道是誰，因為那地方人多，耶穌已經退避了。<br>But he who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, there being a crowd in that place. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>5:14</a></td><td class=td>這事以後，耶穌在殿裏遇見他，對他說，看哪，你已經痊愈了，不要再犯罪，恐怕你遭遇的更加厲害。<br>After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you have become well; sin no more so that nothing worse happens to you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>5:15</a></td><td class=td>那人就去告訴猶太人，使他痊愈的是耶穌。<br>The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was the One who made him well. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>5:16</a></td><td class=td>所以猶太人逼迫耶穌，想要殺祂，因為祂在安息日作了這事。<br>And because of this the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He did these things on the Sabbath. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>5:17</a></td><td class=td>耶穌就對他們說，我父作工直到如今，我也作工。<br>But Jesus answered them, My Father is working until now, and I also am working. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>5:18</a></td><td class=td>所以猶太人就越發想要殺祂，因祂不但犯了安息日，並且稱神為祂的父，將自己與神當作平等。<br>Because of this therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>5:19</a></td><td class=td>耶穌對他們說，我實實在在的告訴你們，子從自己不能作什麼，惟有看見父所作的，子才能作；父所作的事，子也照樣作。<br>Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>5:20</a></td><td class=td>父愛子，將自己所作的一切事指示祂，還要將比這更大的事指示祂，叫你們希奇。<br>For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and greater works than these He will show Him that you may marvel. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>5:21</a></td><td class=td>父怎樣叫死人起來，賜他們生命，子也照樣隨自己的意思賜人生命。<br>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>5:22</a></td><td class=td>父也不審判什麼人，乃將審判的事全交與子，<br>For neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>5:23</a></td><td class=td>叫人都尊敬子，如同尊敬父一樣。不尊敬子的，就是不尊敬差子來的父。<br>In order that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>5:24</a></td><td class=td>我實實在在的告訴你們，那聽我話，又信差我來者的，就有永遠的生命，不至於受審判，乃是已經出死入生了。<br>Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>5:25</a></td><td class=td>我實實在在的告訴你們，時候將到，如今就是了，死人要聽見神兒子的聲音，聽見的人就要活了。<br>Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>5:26</a></td><td class=td>因為父怎樣在自己裏麵有生命，就賜給子也照樣在自己裏麵有生命；<br>For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son to also have life in Himself; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>5:27</a></td><td class=td>並且因為祂是人子，就賜給祂行審判的權柄。<br>And He gave Him authority to execute judgment because He is the Son of Man. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>5:28</a></td><td class=td>你們不要把這事看作希奇，因為時候將到，凡在墳墓裏的，都要聽見祂的聲音，就出來；<br>Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which all in the tombs will hear His voice </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>5:29</a></td><td class=td>行善的歸到生命的複活，作惡的歸到審判的複活。<br>And will come forth: those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have practiced evil, to the resurrection of judgment. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>5:30</a></td><td class=td>我從自己不能作什麼；我怎麼聽見，就怎麼審判；我的審判也是公平的，因為我不尋求自己的意思，隻尋求那差我來者的意思。<br>I can do nothing from Myself; as I hear, I judge, and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will but the will of Him who sent Me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>5:31</a></td><td class=td>我若為自己作見證，我的見證就不真。<br>If I testify concerning Myself, My testimony is not true. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>5:33</a></td><td class=td>你們曾差人到約翰那裏，他為真理作過見證。<br>You have sent people to John, and he has testified to the truth. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>5:34</a></td><td class=td>其實我不接受從人來的見證；然而我說這些話，為要叫你們得救。<br>But it is not from man that I receive My testimony, but I say these things that you may be saved. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>5:35</a></td><td class=td>約翰是點著且發亮的燈，你們情願暫時在他的光中歡騰。<br>He was the lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to exult for a while in his light. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>5:36</a></td><td class=td>但我有比約翰更大的見證，因為父交給我要我完成的工，就是我所作的這些工，為我作見證，我是父所差來的。<br>But I have the testimony which is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father has given Me to finish, the works themselves which I do, testify concerning Me that the Father has sent Me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>5:37</a></td><td class=td>差我來的父，也為我作過見證。你們從來沒有聽過祂的聲音，也沒有見過祂的形狀，<br>And the Father who sent Me, He has testified concerning Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor have you seen His form, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>5:38</a></td><td class=td>並且你們沒有祂的話住在你們裏麵，因為祂所差來的這一位，你們不信。<br>And you do not have His word abiding in you, for Him whom He sent, this One you do not believe. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>5:39</a></td><td class=td>你們查考聖經，因你們以為其中有永遠的生命，為我作見證的就是這經。<br>You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=40>5:40</a></td><td class=td>然而你們不肯到我這裏來得生命。<br>Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=41>5:41</a></td><td class=td>我不接受從人來的榮耀。<br>I do not receive glory from men. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=42>5:42</a></td><td class=td>但我認識你們，知道你們裏麵沒有神的愛。<br>But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=43>5:43</a></td><td class=td>我在我父的名裏來，你們並不接受我；若有別人在自己的名裏來，你們倒要接受他。<br>I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=44>5:44</a></td><td class=td>你們互相受榮耀，卻不尋求從獨一之神來的榮耀，怎能信我呢？<br>How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=45>5:45</a></td><td class=td>不要以為我要向父控告你們；有一位控告你們的，就是你們所仰賴的摩西。<br>Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; there is one who accuses you: Moses, in whom you have set your hope. </td></tr>
