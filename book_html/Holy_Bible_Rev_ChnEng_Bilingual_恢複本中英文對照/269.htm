<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>大衛的仆人也過去十二名。他們彼此揪頭，用刀刺肋，一同仆倒。所以，那地叫作希利甲哈素林，就在基遍。<br>And each seized his opponent by the head, and his sword  went into his opponent's side; and they fell down together.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>2:21</a></td><td class=td>押尼珥對他說，你或轉向右或轉向左，拿住一個少年人，奪取他的戰衣罷。亞撒黑卻不肯轉開不追趕他。<br>And Abner said to him, Turn away to your right or to your left, and seize one of the young men, and take his armor for yourself. But Asahel would not turn away from following him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>2:22</a></td><td class=td>押尼珥又對亞撒黑說，你轉開不要追趕我。我何必將你擊殺在地呢？若那樣，我怎能仰起臉見你哥哥約押呢？<br>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn away from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to Joab your brother?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>2:23</a></td><td class=td>亞撒黑仍不肯轉開；押尼珥就用槍尾刺入他的肚腹，甚至槍從背後透出，亞撒黑就仆倒在那裏，當場死了。眾人趕到亞撒黑仆倒而死的地方，就都站住。<br>But he refused to turn away, so Abner struck him in the stomach with the end of his spear; and the spear came out behind him.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>2:25</a></td><td class=td>便雅憫人聚集，跟隨押尼珥，成為一隊，站在一個山頭上。<br>And the children of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became one troop, and they stood on the top of a hill.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>2:26</a></td><td class=td>押尼珥呼叫約押說，刀劍豈可永遠吞滅人麼？你豈不知終久必有苦楚麼？你要等何時才叫百姓回去不追趕弟兄呢？<br>And Abner called out to Joab and said, Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the end? Then how long shall it be before you command the people to return from following their brothers?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>2:27</a></td><td class=td>約押說，我指著神的生存起誓，你若不說戲耍的那句話，今日早晨百姓就必上去，各人也不會追趕弟兄了。<br>And Joab said, As God lives, if you had not spoken, then surely the people would have gone up each one from following his brother in the morning  only.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>2:28</a></td><td class=td>於是約押吹角，眾民就站住，不再追趕以色列人，也不再打仗了。<br>And Joab blew the trumpet, and all the people stood still; and they pursued after Israel no more, neither did they fight any more.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>2:29</a></td><td class=td>那一整夜，押尼珥和跟隨他的人走過亞拉巴；他們過了約但河，又走過全畢倫，到了瑪哈念。<br>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the Arabah. And they crossed over the Jordan and went through all the Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>2:30</a></td><td class=td>約押追趕押尼珥回來，聚集眾民，見大衛的仆人中缺少了十九個人和亞撒黑。<br>And Joab returned from following Abner. And he gathered all the people together, and among David's servants there were nineteen men missing plus Asahel.</td></tr>
