<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>22:20</a></td><td class=td>從前謝拉的曾孫亞幹，豈不是在那當滅的物上犯了罪麼？那時就有忿怒臨到以色列全會眾；因他罪孽而死的，還不隻他一人。<br>Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the matter of the devoted thing? But there was wrath upon the whole assembly of Israel, and that one man did not perish alone for his iniquity.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>22:24</a></td><td class=td>我們行這事是有原因的，因為顧慮日後你們的子孫可能對我們的子孫說，你們與耶和華以色列的神有何相幹呢？<br>But truly we have done this for a reason and out of a concern that in the future your children might speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with Jehovah the God of Israel?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>22:31</a></td><td class=td>祭司以利亞撒的兒子非尼哈對流便人、迦得人、和瑪拿西人說，今日我們知道耶和華在我們中間，因為你們沒有犯這罪幹犯祂。現在你們救以色列人脫離耶和華的手了。<br>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh, Today we know that Jehovah is in the midst of us, because you have not committed this trespass against Jehovah. Now you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.</td></tr>
