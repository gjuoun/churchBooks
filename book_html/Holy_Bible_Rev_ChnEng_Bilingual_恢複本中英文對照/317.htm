<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>4:1</a></td><td class=td>有一個申言者門徒的妻子哀求以利沙說，你仆人我丈夫死了，他敬畏耶和華是你知道的。現在有債主來，要取我兩個兒子作他的奴仆。<br>Now a certain woman from among the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared Jehovah. And the creditor has come to take my two children to himself as servants.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>4:2</a></td><td class=td>以利沙問她說，我可以為你作什麼呢？你告訴我，你家裏有什麼？<br>And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in your house? And she said, Your servant has nothing at all in the house, except a jar of oil.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>4:3</a></td><td class=td>她說，婢女家中除了一瓶油之外，沒有什麼。以利沙說，你去，到外麵向你眾鄰舍借空器皿，不要少借；<br>And he said, Go and borrow vessels outside, from all your neighbors, empty vessels, and not just a few.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>4:4</a></td><td class=td>然後進屋裏去，把自己和兒子關在門內，你要將油倒在所有的器皿裏，倒滿了的放在一邊。<br>Then go in and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and each one you fill set aside.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>4:5</a></td><td class=td>於是婦人離開以利沙去了，把自己和兒子關在門內；兒子把器皿拿給她，她就倒油。<br>So she went away from him and shut the door behind herself and her sons; and they brought the vessels to her, and she poured out into them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>4:6</a></td><td class=td>器皿都滿了，她對兒子說，再給我拿器皿來。兒子說，再沒有器皿了。油就止住了。<br>And when she had filled the vessels, she said to her son, Bring me another vessel. But he said to her, There is no other vessel. And the oil stopped.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>4:7</a></td><td class=td>婦人去告訴神人，神人說，你去賣油還債，所剩的，你和你兒子可以靠著度日。<br>And she went and told the man of God. And he said, Go and sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons can live off the rest.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>4:8</a></td><td class=td>一日，以利沙經過書念，在那裏有一個大戶的婦人，強留他吃飯。<br>And one day Elisha was passing through Shunem; and there was a wealthy woman there, who compelled him to have a meal. So whenever he passed through, he would turn aside and have a meal there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>4:9</a></td><td class=td>此後，以利沙每從那裏經過，就轉進去吃飯。婦人對丈夫說，我看出那常從我們這裏經過的是聖別的神人。<br>And she said to her husband, Now I know that this man who continually passes through unto us is a holy man of God.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>4:12</a></td><td class=td>以利沙對仆人基哈西說，你叫這書念婦人來。他就把婦人叫了來，婦人站在以利沙麵前。<br>And he said to Gehazi his attendant, Call this Shunammite. And he called her, and she stood before him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>4:13</a></td><td class=td>以利沙告訴仆人，你對她說，你既為我們費了許多心思，有什麼可以為你作的呢？有什麼要替你向王或元帥說的麼？她回答說，我在我本民中安居無事。<br>And he said to him, Say to her, You have gone to all this trouble for us; what can be done for you? Should you be spoken of to the king or to the captain of the army? And she said, I dwell in the midst of my people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>4:14</a></td><td class=td>以利沙對仆人說，究竟當為她作什麼呢？基哈西說，她沒有兒子，她丈夫也老了。<br>And he said, What then can be done for her? And Gehazi said, Indeed she has no son, and her husband is old.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>4:15</a></td><td class=td>以利沙說，再叫她來。於是基哈西叫了她來，她就站在門口。<br>Then he said, Call her. And he called her, and she stood at the door.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>4:16</a></td><td class=td>以利沙說，到明年這時候，你必抱一個兒子。她說，不會的，神人，我主阿，不要欺哄你的婢女。<br>And he said, At this time  next year you shall embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, O man of God, do not deceive your servant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>4:17</a></td><td class=td>婦人果然懷孕，到了次年那時候，生了一個兒子，正如以利沙對她所說的。<br>And the woman conceived and bore a son at that time the next year, as Elisha had told her.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>4:23</a></td><td class=td>丈夫說，今日不是月朔，也不是安息日，你為何要去見他呢？婦人說，平安無事。<br>And he said, Why will you go to him today? It is neither the new moon nor the Sabbath. But she said, It will be fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>4:24</a></td><td class=td>於是她備上驢，對仆人說，你快快趕著走，我若沒有告訴你，就不要為我慢下來。<br>Then she saddled the donkey and said to her attendant, Urge the beast, and do not restrain the ride for me unless I tell you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>4:25</a></td><td class=td>婦人就往迦密山去見神人。神人遠遠的看見她，就對仆人基哈西說，書念的婦人在那裏。<br>So she went. And she came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. And when the man of God saw her at a distance, he said to Gehazi his attendant, That is the Shunammite over there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>4:26</a></td><td class=td>你現在跑去迎接她，問她說，你平安麼？你丈夫平安麼？孩子平安麼？她說，平安。<br>Run now to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child? And she said, It is well.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>4:27</a></td><td class=td>婦人來到山上神人那裏，就抱住神人的腳。基哈西前來要推開她，但神人說，由她罷；因為她魂裏愁苦，耶和華向我隱瞞，沒有指示我。<br>And when she came to the man of God on the mountain, she clung to his feet. And Gehazi approached to pull her away, but the man of God said, Leave her alone; for she is bitter in soul, and Jehovah has hidden  from me and has not told me</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>4:28</a></td><td class=td>婦人說，我何嚐向我主求過兒子呢？我豈沒有說過，不要欺哄我麼？<br>And she said, Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, Do not mislead me?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>4:29</a></td><td class=td>以利沙對基哈西說，你束上腰，手拿我的杖前去。若遇見人，不要向他問安；人若向你問安，也不要回答；要把我的杖放在孩子臉上。<br>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not respond to him. And lay my staff upon the face of the boy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>4:30</a></td><td class=td>孩子的母親說，我指著永活的耶和華和你的性命起誓，我必不離開你。於是以利沙起身，隨著她去了。<br>And the mother of the boy said, As Jehovah lives and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And he rose up and followed her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>4:31</a></td><td class=td>基哈西在他們前麵先去，把杖放在孩子臉上，卻沒有聲音，也沒有動靜。基哈西就迎著以利沙回來，告訴他說，孩子還沒有醒過來。<br>And Gehazi passed on before them and set the staff upon the boy's face, but there was no sound or reaction. Therefore he returned to meet him and told him, saying, The boy has not awakened.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>4:34</a></td><td class=td>又上床伏在孩子身上，口對口，眼對眼，手對手；既俯伏在孩子身上，孩子的身體就漸漸溫暖起來。<br>Then he got up and lay on the child, and he put his mouth on his mouth and his eyes on his eyes and his palms on his palms; and he stretched himself over him, and the flesh of the child became warm.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>4:36</a></td><td class=td>以利沙叫基哈西說，你叫那書念婦人來；於是基哈西去叫她。她來到以利沙那裏，以利沙說，將你兒子抱起來。<br>And he called Gehazi and said, Call that Shunammite. So he called her. And when she came to him, he said, Take up your son.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>4:38</a></td><td class=td>以利沙又來到吉甲，那地正有饑荒。申言者的門徒坐在他麵前，他對仆人說，你將大鍋放在火上，給申言者的門徒熬湯。<br>Then Elisha returned to Gilgal, and there was a famine in the land. And the sons of the prophets sat before him. And he said to his attendant, Put on the big pot, and boil some stew for the sons of the prophets.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>4:39</a></td><td class=td>有一個人出到田野掐菜，遇見一棵野瓜藤，就摘了一兜野瓜；他進來把瓜切了，擱在熬湯的鍋中，他們並不知道那是什麼東西。<br>And one went out into the field to gather herbs.
