<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>8:5</a></td><td class=td>這耶路撒冷的民，為何恒久背道呢？他們持定詭詐，不肯回頭。<br>Why has this people Jerusalem Turned away in perpetual apostasy? They hold fast to deceit; They refuse to turn back.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>8:6</a></td><td class=td>我留心聽且聽見了，他們說不正直的話；無人懊悔自己的惡行，說，我作了什麼呢？他們各人轉奔己路，如馬直闖戰場。<br>I have listened carefully and heard; They have not spoken rightly; There is no one who repents of his wickedness, Saying, What have I done? Everyone turns to his own course, Like a horse rushing headlong into battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>8:7</a></td><td class=td>空中的鸛鳥，知道來去的定期；斑鳩、燕子和白鶴，也守候當來的時令；我的百姓，卻不知道耶和華的律例。<br>Even the stork in the sky Knows its appointed times, And the turtledove and the swallow and the crane Keep the time of their coming; But My people do not know The ordinance of Jehovah.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>8:10</a></td><td class=td>所以我必將他們的妻子給別人，將他們的田地給別人為業；因為他們從最小的到至大的，人人都貪圖不義之財；從申言者到祭司，個個都行事虛謊。<br>Therefore I will give their wives to others, Their fields to those who will possess them; For from the small unto the great, Everyone is wresting unjust gain; From the prophet even to the priest, Everyone is dealing falsely.</td></tr>

They were not at all ashamed; They did not even know to blush. Therefore they will fall with those who fall; At the time of their punishment they will stumble, Says Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>8:13</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，我必將他們收取淨盡；葡萄樹上必沒有葡萄，無花果樹上必沒有無花果，葉子也必枯幹；我所賜給他們的，已離開他們過去。<br>I will utterly take them away, Declares Jehovah; There are no grapes on the vine, And there are no figs on the fig  tree; Even the leaves are withered; And what I gave them has passed away from them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>8:14</a></td><td class=td>我們為何坐著不動？你們當聚集，進入堅固城，在那裏靜默不言；因為耶和華我們的神，使我們靜默不言，又將苦毒的水給我們喝，都因我們得罪了耶和華。<br>Why do we sit? Gather yourselves, And let us go up to the fortified cities And be silent there, Because Jehovah our God \caps0 2has silenced us And made us drink poisonous water, Because we have sinned against Jehovah.</td></tr>

And they come and devour the land and its fullness, The city and those who dwell in it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>8:17</a></td><td class=td>因為我必打發毒蛇到你們中間，是沒有法術能製伏的；牠們必咬你們；這是耶和華說的。<br>For I will send among you serpents, Adders, for which there is no enchantment; And they will bite you, Declares Jehovah.</td></tr>

Is her King not in her? Why have they provoked Me to  anger With their graven images and with strange idols?</td></tr>
