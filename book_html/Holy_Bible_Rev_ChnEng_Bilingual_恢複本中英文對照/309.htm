<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>18:2</a></td><td class=td>以利亞就去，要使亞哈得見他。那時，在撒瑪利亞的饑荒甚重。<br>And Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. And the famine was severe in Samaria.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>18:3</a></td><td class=td>亞哈將他的家宰俄巴底召了來。(俄巴底甚是敬畏耶和華；<br>And Ahab called for Obadiah, who was over his house. (Now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>18:4</a></td><td class=td>耶洗別剪除耶和華眾申言者的時候，俄巴底將一百個申言者，每五十人藏在一個洞裏，拿餅和水供養他們。)<br>And when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and kept them fed with bread and water.)</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>18:5</a></td><td class=td>亞哈對俄巴底說，你去走遍這地，到一切水泉旁和一切溪邊；或者我們找得著青草，可以救活騾馬，免得喪失一些牲口。<br>And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land, to all the springs of water and to all the brooks; perhaps we will find grass to keep the horses and the mules alive and not lose some of the animals.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>18:6</a></td><td class=td>於是二人分地巡行，亞哈獨走一路，俄巴底獨走一路。<br>And they divided the land between them in order to pass through it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>18:7</a></td><td class=td>俄巴底在路上恰與以利亞相遇，俄巴底認出他來，就麵伏於地，說，你真是我主以利亞麼？<br>And while Obadiah was on the way, Elijah met him at that moment; and he recognized him and fell on his face and said, Is it indeed you, my lord Elijah?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>18:8</a></td><td class=td>以利亞對他說，我是。你去告訴你主人，以利亞在這裏。<br>And he said to him, It is I. Go and say to your lord, Elijah is here.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>18:12</a></td><td class=td>恐怕我一離開你，耶和華的靈就提你到我所不知道的地方去；這樣，我去告訴亞哈，他若找不著你，就必殺我；仆人卻是自幼敬畏耶和華的。<br>And it will happen that when I go away from you, the Spirit of Jehovah will carry you off, I know not where; and when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he will slay me, although I your servant have feared Jehovah since my youth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>18:13</a></td><td class=td>耶洗別殺耶和華眾申言者的時候，我將耶和華的一百個申言者，每五十人藏在一個洞裏，拿餅和水供養他們，豈沒有人將我所作的這事告訴我主麼？<br>Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of Jehovah, that I hid a hundred of Jehovah's prophets by fifties in a cave and kept them fed with bread and water?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>18:14</a></td><td class=td>現在你說，要去告訴你主人，以利亞在這裏；他必殺我。<br>And now you say, Go and say to your lord, Elijah is here; and he will slay me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>18:15</a></td><td class=td>以利亞說，我指著永活的萬軍之耶和華，就是我侍立在祂麵前的那位起誓，我今日必使亞哈得見我。<br>Then Elijah said, As Jehovah of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will present myself to him today.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>18:16</a></td><td class=td>於是俄巴底去迎著亞哈，告訴他；亞哈就去迎著以利亞。<br>Then Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and he told him. And Ahab went to meet Elijah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>18:17</a></td><td class=td>亞哈見了以利亞，便說，使以色列遭災的就是你麼？<br>And when Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, Is that you, the troubler of Israel?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>18:18</a></td><td class=td>以利亞說，使以色列遭災的不是我，乃是你和你父家；因為你們離棄耶和華的誡命，去隨從諸巴力。<br>And he said, I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father's house have, in that you have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah and have gone after the Baals.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>18:19</a></td><td class=td>現在你當差遣人，招聚以色列眾人，和耶洗別所供養，巴力的那四百五十個申言者，以及亞舍拉的那四百個申言者，使他們都上迦密山去見我。<br>And now send word, and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, as well as the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>18:20</a></td><td class=td>亞哈就差遣人到以色列眾人那裏，招聚眾申言者上迦密山。<br>So Ahab sent word to all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together unto Mount Carmel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>18:21</a></td><td class=td>以利亞前來對眾民說，你們心持兩意要到幾時呢？若耶和華是神，就當跟從耶和華；若巴力是神，就當跟從巴力。眾民一言不答。<br>Then Elijah came near to all the people and said, How long will you go hopping between two opinions? If Jehovah is God, follow Him; but if Baal is, follow him. And the people did not answer him a word.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>18:22</a></td><td class=td>以利亞對眾民說，作耶和華申言者的，隻剩下我一個人，巴力的申言者，卻有四百五十人。<br>And Elijah said to the people, I alone am left as a prophet of Jehovah, but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>18:23</a></td><td class=td>當給我們兩隻公牛，巴力的申言者可以挑選一隻，切成塊子放在柴上，不要點火；<br>Let them therefore give us two bulls. And let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and put it on the wood, but let them apply no fire; and I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood, and I will apply no fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>18:24</a></td><td class=td>我也豫備一隻公牛放在柴上，也不點火。你們呼求你們神的名，我也呼求耶和華的名；那降火回應的神，就是神。眾民回答說，這話甚好。<br>Then call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Jehovah; and the God who answers by fire, He will be God. And all the people answered and said, The word seems good.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>18:25</a></td><td class=td>以利亞對巴力的申言者說，你們既是人多，當先挑選一隻公牛，豫備好了，就呼求你們神的名，卻不要點火。<br>And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose one bull for yourselves, and prepare it first, for there are many of you. And call on the name of your god, but apply no fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>18:26</a></td><td class=td>他們將所給他們的公牛豫備好了，從早晨到午間，呼求巴力的名，說，巴力阿，求你回應我們！卻沒有聲音，沒有回應的。他們在所築的壇四圍踴跳。<br>So they took the bull which had been given them and prepared it; and they called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, O Baal, answer us! But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they leaped around the altar that had been made.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>18:27</a></td><td class=td>到了正午，以利亞嬉笑他們，說，大聲呼求罷，因為他是神；他或在默想，或走到一邊，或在行路。他或在睡覺，就要醒來。<br>Then at noon Elijah mocked them and said, Cry out with a loud voice, for he is a god; for he is meditating or has wandered off or is on a journey. Perhaps he is asleep and will awake.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>18:28</a></td><td class=td>他們大聲呼求，按著他們的規矩，用刀槍自割自刺，直到血流滿身。<br>And they cried out with a loud voice and cut themselves, according to their custom, with swords and spears until blood gushed out all over them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>18:29</a></td><td class=td>中午過後，他們狂呼亂叫，直到獻晚祭的時候，卻沒有聲音，沒有回應的，也沒有理會的。<br>And when noon had past, they prophesied until the time of the offering up of the meal offering; but there was no voice nor any that answered nor any attention paid.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>18:30</a></td><td class=td>以利亞對眾民說，你們到我這裏來。眾民就到他那裏。他便重修已經毀壞的耶和華的壇。<br>Then Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah which was broken down.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>18:31</a></td><td class=td>以利亞照雅各子孫支派的數目，取了十二塊石頭，(耶和華的話曾臨到雅各，說，你的名要叫以色列，)<br>And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob (to whom the word of Jehovah came, saying, Israel shall be your name);</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>18:32</a></td><td class=td>用這些石頭在耶和華的名裏築一座壇，在壇的四圍挖溝，可容穀種二細亞。<br>And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah, and he made a trench around the altar, with a capacity of two measures of seed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>18:33</a></td><td class=td>他又在壇上擺好了柴，把公牛切成塊子，放在柴上，說，你們用四個桶盛滿水，倒在燔祭和柴上；<br>And he arranged the wood and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four jars with water, and pour the water on the burnt offering and on the wood.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>18:36</a></td><td class=td>到了獻晚祭的時候，申言者以利亞近前來，說，亞伯拉罕、以撒、以色列的神，耶和華阿，求你今日使人知道你在以色列中是神，也知道我是你的仆人，又是憑你的話行這一切事。<br>Then at the time of the offering up of the meal offering, Elijah the prophet came near and said, O Jehovah, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known today that You are God in Israel and that I am Your servant and that I have done all these things by Your word.</td></tr>
