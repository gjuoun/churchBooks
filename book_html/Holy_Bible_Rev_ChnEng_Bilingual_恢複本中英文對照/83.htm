<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>33:1</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對摩西說，現在你和你從埃及地領上來的百姓，要離開這裏，上我所起誓要賜給亞伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的地去；我曾對他們說，要將這地賜給他們的後裔。<br>Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, Depart; go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed I will give it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>33:2</a></td><td class=td>我要差遣使者在你前麵；我要攆出迦南人、亞摩利人、赫人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人。<br>And I will send an Angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>33:3</a></td><td class=td>你們要上去，到那流奶與蜜之地；我不在你們中間同你們上去，恐怕我在路上把你們滅絕，因為你們是硬著頸項的百姓。<br>Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, lest I consume you in the way, for you are a stiffnecked people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>33:4</a></td><td class=td>百姓聽見這凶信，就悲哀，也沒有人佩戴妝飾。<br>And when the people heard this evil word, they mourned, and no one put on his ornaments.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>33:5</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對摩西說，你告訴以色列人，耶和華說，你們是硬著頸項的百姓，我隻要片時在你們中間同你們上去，必會滅絕你們。現在你們要把身上的妝飾脫下來，我好知道怎樣待你們。<br>Now Jehovah had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiffnecked people; if I were to go up in your midst for one moment, I would consume you. Now therefore put off your ornaments from you, and I will decide what to do to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>33:6</a></td><td class=td>因此，以色列人從住何烈山以後，就把身上的妝飾摘除幹淨。<br>Thus the children of Israel were stripped of their ornaments from Mount Horeb onward.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>33:7</a></td><td class=td>摩西將帳棚支搭在營外，離營一段距離，他稱這帳棚為會幕。凡求問耶和華的，就出到營外的會幕那裏去。<br>Now Moses would take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, some distance from the camp; and he called it the Tent of Meeting. And everyone who sought Jehovah went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>33:8</a></td><td class=td>當摩西出營到會幕去的時候，百姓就都起來，各人站在自己帳棚的門口，望著摩西，直等到他進了會幕。<br>And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise up and stand, every man at the entrance of his tent, and gaze after Moses, until he entered the tent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>33:9</a></td><td class=td>摩西進會幕的時候，雲柱就降下來，停在會幕的門口，耶和華便與摩西說話。<br>And whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stay at the entrance of the tent, and Jehovah would speak with Moses.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>33:11</a></td><td class=td>耶和華與摩西麵對麵說話，好像人與同伴說話一般。摩西回到營裏去，但他的幫手，一個少年人，就是嫩的兒子約書亞，不離開會幕。<br>And Jehovah would speak to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks to his companion. And Moses would return to the camp, but his attendant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart out of the tent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>33:12</a></td><td class=td>摩西對耶和華說，看哪，你對我說，將這百姓領上去，卻沒有讓我知道你要差遣誰與我同去，隻是你曾說，我按你的名認識你，你在我眼前也蒙了恩。<br>And Moses said to Jehovah, See, You say to me, Bring up this people; but You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, I know you by name, and you have also found favor in My sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>33:13</a></td><td class=td>我如今若在你眼前蒙恩，求你叫我知道你的法則，使我可以認識你，好在你眼前繼續蒙恩。求你也想到這民是你的百姓。<br>Now therefore if I have found favor in Your sight, please let me know now Your ways, that I may know You, so that I may continue to find favor in Your sight. Consider also that this nation is Your people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>33:14</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，我的同在必和你同去，使你得安息。<br>And He said, My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>33:15</a></td><td class=td>摩西對祂說，你的同在若不和我們同去，就不要把我們從這裏領上去。<br>And he said to Him, If Your presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>33:16</a></td><td class=td>人如何得以知道，我和你的百姓在你眼前蒙恩？豈不是因你與我們同去，使我和你的百姓與地上的萬民有分別麼？<br>For how then shall it be known that I have found favor in Your sight, I and Your people? Is it not by Your going with us, so that we, I and Your people, are distinct from all the other people who are on the face of the earth?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>33:17</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對摩西說，你所說的這事我也要行；因為你在我眼前蒙了恩，並且我按你的名認識你。<br>And Jehovah said to Moses, I will do this thing also that you have spoken; for you have found favor in My sight, and I know you by name.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>33:18</a></td><td class=td>摩西說，求你將你的榮耀顯給我看。<br>And he said, Please show me Your glory.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>33:19</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，我要使我一切的美善，在你麵前經過，並要在你麵前宣告耶和華的名。我要向誰施恩惠，就向誰施恩惠；要對誰動憐恤，就對誰動憐恤；<br>And He said, I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of Jehovah before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>33:20</a></td><td class=td>又說，你不能看見我的麵，因為沒有人看見我的麵還能存活。<br>But He said, You cannot see My face; for no man shall see Me and live.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>33:21</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，看哪，在我這裏有個地方，你要站在磐石上；<br>Then Jehovah said, Here there is a place by Me, and you shall stand upon the rock;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>33:22</a></td><td class=td>我的榮耀經過的時候，我要將你放在磐石穴中，用我的手掌遮掩你，直等我過去；<br>And while My glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with My palm until I have passed by.</td></tr>
