<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>42:2</a></td><td class=td>這聖屋長一百肘，有向北的門，屋寬五十肘。<br>The length of the side of the northern entrance was a hundred cubits, and the width was fifty cubits.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>42:5</a></td><td class=td>上層聖屋因為樓廊占去些地方，所以比中下兩層窄些。<br>Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more space away from these than from the lower and the middle stories in the building.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>42:6</a></td><td class=td>因為聖屋有三層，卻無柱子，不像外院的屋子有柱子；所以上層比中下兩層更窄。<br>For they were arranged in three stories, and they did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper story was set back from the ground more than the lower and middle stories  .</td></tr>

There they put down the most holy things, the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering, for the place is holy.</td></tr>

And they shall put on other garments and approach the area designated for the people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>42:15</a></td><td class=td>祂量完了內殿，就帶我出朝東的門，量院的四圍。<br>Now when He had finished measuring the inner house, He brought me out through the gate which faces toward the east and measured it all around.</td></tr>
