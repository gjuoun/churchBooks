<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>眾祭司阿，現今這誡命是給你們的。<br>And now this commandment is for you, O priests.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>萬軍之耶和華說，你們若不聽從，也不放在心上，將榮耀歸與我的名，我就要差咒詛到你們中間，咒詛你們的福分；因你們不把誡命放在心上，我已經咒詛這些福分了。<br>If you will not hear and take it to heart to give glory to My name, says Jehovah of hosts, I will send the curse among you, and I will curse your blessings; indeed I have cursed them already because you have not taken it to heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>我必斥責你們的種子，又把糞，就是你們節期祭牲的糞，潑在你們的臉上；人要把你們與糞一同除掉。<br>I will rebuke your seed and spread dung upon your faces, the dung of your feasts; and they will take you away with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>你們就知道我傳這誡命給你們，使我與利未所立的約，可以常存；這是萬軍之耶和華說的。<br>And you will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that My covenant may remain with Levi, says Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>我曾與他立生命和平安的約；我將這兩樣賜給他，使他心存敬畏；他就敬畏我，懼怕我的名。<br>My covenant was with him as life and peace; and I gave these to him that he might fear; and he did fear Me, and he did stand in awe of My name.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>真理的律法在他口中，他嘴裏沒有不義；他在平安和正直裏與我同行，使多人回頭離開罪孽。<br>The law of truth was in his mouth, and no wrong was found in his lips; in peace and uprightness he walked with Me, and he turned many away from iniquity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>祭司的嘴當謹守知識，人也當由他口中尋求訓誨，因為他是萬軍之耶和華的使者。<br>For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and men should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the mes- senger of Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>你們卻偏離正道，使許多人在律法上跌倒；你們廢棄我與利未所立的約；這是萬軍之耶和華說的。<br>But you have turned away from the way; you have caused many to stumble at the law; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>所以我也使你們在眾人麵前被藐視，看為下賤，因你們不遵行我的道路，竟在律法上偏袒人。<br>Therefore I also have made you despicable and base before all the people to the same extent that you have not kept My ways but have been respecters of persons in the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>我們豈不都有一位父麼？豈不是一位神所造的麼？我們各人怎麼以詭詐待弟兄，瀆犯了神與我們列祖所立的約呢？<br>Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why are we treacherous, each one to his brother, thus profaning the covenant of our fathers?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>猶大人行事詭詐，並且在以色列和耶路撒冷中，行了一件可憎的事；因為猶大人褻瀆耶和華所愛的聖所，娶事奉外邦神的女子為妻。<br>Judah has been treacherous, and an abomination has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the  sanctuary of Jehovah, which He loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>凡行這事的，無論是叫醒的、答應的、或是獻供物給萬軍之耶和華的，耶和華也必從雅各的帳棚中剪除他。<br>As regards the man who does this, Jehovah will cut off from the tents of Jacob him who wakes and him who answers and him who offers a sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>你們又行了一件這樣的事，使眼淚，使哭泣和歎息遮蓋耶和華的祭壇，以致耶和華不再垂看那供物，也不樂意從你們手中收納。<br>And this second thing you do: You cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping and sighing, so that He no longer regards the sacrifice or receives it with pleasure from your hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>你們還說，這是為什麼呢？因耶和華在你和你幼年所娶的妻子中間作證人；她雖是你的伴侶，又是你盟約的妻子，你卻以詭詐待她。<br>Yet you say, For what reason? Because Jehovah has been the witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been treacherous; yet she is your companion and your wife of covenant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>然而神豈不是使二人成為一麼？祂靈的餘裔是屬祂的。為何成為一呢？乃是要得著屬神的後裔。所以當謹守你們的靈，誰也不可以詭詐待自己幼年所娶的妻子。<br>But did He not make them one? And the remnant of the Spirit was His. And why the one? He sought the seed of God. Take heed then to your spirit, and let no one be treacherous to the wife of his youth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>耶和華以色列的神說，休妻是我所恨惡的，休妻的人是以強暴行事；所以當謹守你們的靈，不可行詭詐；這是萬軍之耶和華說的。<br>For I hate divorce, says Jehovah the God of Israel; and he who does it  behaves in violence, says Jehovah of hosts. Take heed then to your spirit, and do not be treacherous.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>你們用言語使耶和華厭煩；你們還說，我們在何事上使祂厭煩呢？因為你們說，凡行惡的，耶和華眼看為善，並且祂喜悅他們；或說，公平的神在那裏呢？<br>You have wearied Jehovah with your words; but you say, How have we wearied Him? By saying, Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and He delights in them; or, Where is the God of justice?</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
