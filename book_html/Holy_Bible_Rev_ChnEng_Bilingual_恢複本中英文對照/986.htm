<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>13:2</a></td><td class=td>耶穌回答他們說，因著這些加利利人受這害，你們就以為他們比所有的加利利人更有罪麼？<br>And He answered and said to them, Do you think that these Galileans were sinners beyond all the Galileans because they suffered these things? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>13:3</a></td><td class=td>我告訴你們，不是的。你們若不悔改，都要如此滅亡。<br>No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>13:4</a></td><td class=td>從前西羅亞樓倒塌，壓死十八個人，你們以為他們比一切住在耶路撒冷的人更有虧欠麼？<br>Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were debtors beyond all the men dwelling in Jerusalem? </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>13:6</a></td><td class=td>於是祂說了這個比喻：一個人有一棵無花果樹，栽在他的葡萄園裏。他來，在樹上找果子，卻找不著。<br>And He told this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. And he came seeking fruit on it and did not find any. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>13:7</a></td><td class=td>就對管園的說，看哪，這三年我來，在這無花果樹上找果子，竟找不著，把它砍了吧，何必還白占地土？<br>And he said to the vinedresser, Behold, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I have not found any. Cut it down therefore. Why does it also make the ground useless? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>13:8</a></td><td class=td>管園的回答他說，主啊，今年且留著，等我周圍掘開土，堆上肥；<br>But he answered and said to him, Master, leave it this year also, until I dig around it and throw on manure. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>13:9</a></td><td class=td>將來若真結果子便罷，不然再把它砍了。<br>And if it produces fruit in the future, good; otherwise, cut it down. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>13:12</a></td><td class=td>耶穌看見，便叫過她來，對她說，女人，你脫離這病了。<br>And Jesus, seeing her, called her to Him and said to her, Woman, you are released from your infirmity. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>13:13</a></td><td class=td>於是用兩隻手按著她，她立刻直起腰來，就榮耀神。<br>And He laid His hands on her, and instantly she was made erect and began to glorify God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>13:14</a></td><td class=td>管會堂的因為耶穌在安息日治病，就氣忿忿的對群眾說，有六日應當作工，在那六日之內，可以來求醫，在安息日卻不可。<br>But the ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, answered and said to the crowd, There are six days in which man should work; therefore, come on them and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>13:15</a></td><td class=td>主卻回答他說，假冒為善的人哪，難道你們各人在安息日不解開槽上的牛驢，牽去飲麼？<br>But the Lord answered him and said, Hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away and water it? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>13:16</a></td><td class=td>何況這女人本是亞伯拉罕的後裔，看哪，她被撒但捆綁了十八年，不當在安息日解開她的捆鎖麼？<br>And this woman, being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has bound, behold, for eighteen years, should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>13:17</a></td><td class=td>耶穌說這話，一切敵對祂的人都羞愧了。群眾因祂所行一切榮耀的事，就都歡喜。<br>And when He said these things, all those opposing Him were put to shame, and all the crowd rejoiced over all the glorious things that were being done by Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>13:18</a></td><td class=td>耶穌說，神的國好像什麼？我可把它比作什麼？<br>He said therefore, What is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I liken it? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>13:19</a></td><td class=td>好像一粒芥菜種，有人拿去撒在自己的園子裏，長大成樹，天空的飛鳥棲宿在它的枝上。<br>It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and threw into his own garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of heaven roosted in its branches. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>13:20</a></td><td class=td>祂又說，我可把神的國比作什麼？<br>And again He said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>13:21</a></td><td class=td>好像麵酵，有婦人拿去藏在三鬥麵裏，直到全團都發了酵。<br>It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>13:22</a></td><td class=td>耶穌往耶路撒冷去，在所經過的各城各鄉施教。<br>And He journeyed throughout the cities and villages, teaching and making His way toward Jerusalem. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>13:24</a></td><td class=td>耶穌對眾人說，你們要竭力進窄門，因為我告訴你們，將來有許多人想要進去，卻是不能。<br>And He said to them, Struggle to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will seek to enter, yet will not be able. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>13:25</a></td><td class=td>及至家主起來關了門，你們才站在外麵叩門，說，主啊，給我們開門，祂就要回答你們說，我不認識你們，不曉得你們是那裏來的。<br>Once the Master of the house has risen and shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door, saying, Lord, open to us, then He will answer and say to you, I do not know you, nor where you are from. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>13:26</a></td><td class=td>那時，你們要說，我們在你麵前吃過、喝過，你也在我們的街上施教過。<br>Then you will begin to say, We ate in Your presence and drank, and You taught in our streets. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>13:27</a></td><td class=td>祂要說，我告訴你們，我不曉得你們是那裏來的；你們這一切行不義的人，離開我去吧。<br>And He will say, I tell you, I do not know where you are from. Go away from Me, all you workers of unrighteousness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>13:28</a></td><td class=td>你們要看見亞伯拉罕、以撒、雅各、和眾申言者都在神的國裏，你們卻被扔在外麵，在那裏必要哀哭切齒了。<br>There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth there when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you being cast outside. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>13:29</a></td><td class=td>從東、從西、從北、從南，將有人來，在神的國裏坐席。<br>And they will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and will recline at table in the kingdom of God. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>13:33</a></td><td class=td>雖然這樣，今天明天後天，我必須前行，因為申言者在耶路撒冷之外喪命是不合宜的。<br>However, I must journey today and tomorrow and on the following day because it is not acceptable for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>13:34</a></td><td class=td>耶路撒冷啊，耶路撒冷啊，你常殺害申言者，又用石頭打死那奉差遣到你這裏來的。我多次願意聚集你的兒女，好像母雞把自己的小雞聚集在翅膀底下，隻是你們不願意。<br>Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her!
