<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>15:1</a></td><td class=td>過了些日子，到割麥子的時候，參孫帶著一隻山羊羔去看他的妻子，說，我要進內室見我的妻子。他嶽父不讓他進去，<br>Then after some time, during the days of the wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a kid. And he said, Let me go into the chamber to my wife; but her father would not allow him to go in.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>15:2</a></td><td class=td>說，我估定你是極其恨她，因此我將她給了你的伴友。她的妹妹不是比她還美麼？可以代替她歸給你罷。<br>And her father said, I surely thought that you utterly hated her, so I gave her to your best man. Is not her younger sister better than she? Let her be yours instead of her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>15:3</a></td><td class=td>參孫對他們說，這次我雖然加害非利士人，我對他們也不算有罪。<br>Then Samson said to them, This time I will be blameless with regard to the Philistines when I do them harm.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>15:4</a></td><td class=td>於是參孫去捉了三百隻狐狸，又取了火把來，將狐狸尾巴對著尾巴捆上，將一枝火把捆在兩條尾巴中間；<br>And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes; and he took torches and turned the foxes tail to tail and put one torch in between every two tails.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>15:5</a></td><td class=td>他點著火把，就放狐狸進入非利士人站著的禾稼，將堆積的禾捆和站著的禾稼，並葡萄園、橄欖園盡都燒了。<br>Then he set the torches on fire and sent the foxes into the Philistines' standing grain and burned up the shocks and the standing grain as well as the vineyards and the olive groves.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>15:6</a></td><td class=td>非利士人說，這事是誰作的？有人說，是亭拿人的女婿參孫，因為他嶽父將他的妻子給了他的伴友。於是非利士人上去，用火燒了婦人和她的父親。<br>And the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they said, Samson, the son- in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his best man. And the Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>15:7</a></td><td class=td>參孫對非利士人說，你們既然這樣行，我必向你們報仇才肯罷休。<br>And Samson said to them, If this is how you act, I will surely take revenge on you, and then I will stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>15:8</a></td><td class=td>參孫就大大擊殺他們，連腿帶腰都砍斷了。隨後他下去，住在以坦磐石的穴內。<br>And he struck them hip and thigh, a great slaughter. And he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>15:9</a></td><td class=td>非利士人上去安營在猶大，散開攻擊利希。<br>And the Philistines rose up and encamped in Judah, and they spread out against Lehi.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>15:10</a></td><td class=td>猶大人說，你們為何上來攻擊我們呢？他們說，我們上來是要捆綁參孫；他向我們怎樣行，我們也要向他怎樣行。<br>And the men of Judah said, Why have you come up against us? And they said, We have come up to bind Samson, so that we can do to him as he has done to us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>15:11</a></td><td class=td>於是有三千猶大人下到以坦磐石的穴內，對參孫說，非利士人轄製我們，你不知道麼？你向我們行的是什麼事呢？他回答說，他們向我怎樣行，我也向他們怎樣行。<br>Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam; and they said to Samson, Do you not know that the Philistines rule over us? Then what is this that you have done to us? And he said to them, As they have done to me, so I have done to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>15:12</a></td><td class=td>猶大人對他說，我們下來是要捆綁你，將你交在非利士人手中。參孫說，你們要向我起誓，應承你們自己不殺害我。<br>And they said to him, We have come down to bind you up so that we can deliver you into hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me that you will not fall upon me yourselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>15:13</a></td><td class=td>他們說，我們隻要將你捆綁交在非利士人手中，我們斷不會殺你。於是用兩條新繩捆綁參孫，將他從以坦磐石帶上去。<br>And they spoke to him, saying, No, we will only bind you and deliver you into their hand, but we certainly will not put you to death. And they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>15:14</a></td><td class=td>參孫到了利希，非利士人都迎著呐喊。耶和華的靈衝擊參孫，他臂上的繩就像火燒的麻一樣，他的綁繩都從他手上脫落下來。<br>When he came into Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. And the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax when it burns in fire; and his bonds melted from off his hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>15:15</a></td><td class=td>他見一塊未幹的驢腮骨，就伸手拾起來，用以擊殺一千人。<br>And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass; and he stretched out his hand and took it, and struck a thousand men with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>15:16</a></td><td class=td>參孫說，我用驢腮骨殺人成堆，用驢腮骨殺了一千人。<br>And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, A heap upon a double heap; With the jawbone of an ass, I have struck a thousand men dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>15:17</a></td><td class=td>說完這話，就把那腮骨從手裏拋出去了；他便把那地方叫作拉末利希。<br>And when he finished speaking, he cast the jawbone from his hand; and he called that place Ramath-lehi.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>15:18</a></td><td class=td>參孫甚覺口渴，就呼求耶和華說，你既藉仆人的手施行這麼大的拯救，我現在豈可渴死，落在未受割禮的人手中？<br>And he was very thirsty, and he called on Jehovah, saying, You have granted this great victory by the hand of Your servant. And will I now die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>15:19</a></td><td class=td>神就使利希的窪處裂開，有水從其中湧出來。參孫喝了，靈裏得恢複，就複蘇過來；因此他給那泉起名叫隱哈歌利，那泉直到今日還在利希。<br>But God broke open the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came forth from it. And when he drank, his spirit returned and he was revived; therefore he called the name of  that place En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>15:20</a></td><td class=td>當非利士人轄製以色列人的時候，參孫作以色列的士師二十年。<br>And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
