<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>16:1</a></td><td class=td>耶穌又對門徒說，有一個財主，他有一個管家，有人向他控告這人揮霍主人的財物。<br>And He said also to the disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and this one was accused to him of squandering his possessions. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>16:2</a></td><td class=td>主人叫管家來，對他說，我所聽到關於你的事，是怎麼樣？把你管家職分的賬目交代清楚，因你不能再作管家了。<br>And he called him and said to him, What is this I hear concerning you? Render the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>16:3</a></td><td class=td>那管家心裏說，主人要撤去我的管家職分，我該作什麼才好？鋤地吧，無力；討飯吧，怕羞。<br>And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, because my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>16:4</a></td><td class=td>我知道該怎麼作，好叫人在我被撤去管家職分之後，可以接我到他們家裏去。<br>I know what I will do so that when I am removed from the stewardship they may receive me into their own houses. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>16:5</a></td><td class=td>於是把欠他主人債的，一個一個的叫了來，問頭一個說，你欠我主人多少？<br>And when he had called to him each one of his master's debtors, he said to the first, How much do you owe my master? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>16:6</a></td><td class=td>他說，一百簍油。管家說，拿你的賬，快坐下寫五十。<br>And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>16:7</a></td><td class=td>又問另一個說，你欠多少？他說，一百石麥子。管家說，拿你的賬寫八十。<br>Then to another he said, And you, how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He said to him, Take your bill and write eighty. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>16:8</a></td><td class=td>主人就誇獎這不義的管家作事精明；因為今世之子對待自己的世代，比光明之子更加精明。<br>And the master praised the unrighteous steward because he had acted prudently; for the sons of this age are more prudent in their dealings with their own generation than the sons of light. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>16:9</a></td><td class=td>我又告訴你們，要藉著那不義的錢財，為自己結交朋友，到了錢財無用的時候，他們可以接你們到永遠的帳幕裏去。<br>And I say to you, Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>16:10</a></td><td class=td>在最小的事上忠信的，在許多事上也必忠信；在最小的事上不義的，在許多事上也必不義。<br>He who is faithful in the least is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in much. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>16:11</a></td><td class=td>你們若是在不義的錢財上不忠信，誰還把那真實的信托你們？<br>If therefore you have not become faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you what is true? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>16:12</a></td><td class=td>你們若是在別人的東西上不忠信，誰還把你們自己的東西給你們？<br>And if you have not become faithful in that which belongs to another, who will give to you that which is your own? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>16:13</a></td><td class=td>沒有一個家仆能事奉兩個主；因為他不是恨這個愛那個，就是忠於這個輕視那個。你們不能事奉神，又事奉瑪門。<br>No household servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>16:14</a></td><td class=td>法利賽人是貪愛錢財的，他們聽見這一切話，就嗤笑耶穌。<br>And the Pharisees, being lovers of money, heard all these things and were sneering at Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>16:15</a></td><td class=td>耶穌對他們說，你們是在人麵前自稱為義的，但神知道你們的心；因為在人中間高貴的，在神麵前卻是可憎的。<br>And He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>16:16</a></td><td class=td>律法和申言者到約翰為止；從此神的國當作福音傳開了，人人強力奪取要進去。<br>The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed as the gospel, and everyone forces his way into it. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>16:17</a></td><td class=td>天地過去，比律法的一畫落空還容易。<br>But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one serif of the law to fail. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>16:18</a></td><td class=td>凡休妻另娶的，就是犯奸淫；娶被丈夫所休之婦人的，也是犯奸淫。<br>Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>16:19</a></td><td class=td>有一個財主，素常穿著紫色袍和細麻布衣服，天天奢華宴樂。<br>Now there was a certain rich man, and he clothed himself in purple and fine linen, making merry every day in splendor. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>16:20</a></td><td class=td>又有一個討飯的，名叫拉撒路，渾身生瘡，被人丟在財主門口，<br>And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>16:21</a></td><td class=td>巴不得從財主桌子上掉下來的東西得飽足；不但如此，連狗也來舔他的瘡。<br>And longing to be satisfied with the things falling from the rich man's table; moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>16:22</a></td><td class=td>後來那討飯的死了，被天使帶去放在亞伯拉罕的懷裏；財主也死了，並且埋葬了。<br>And the beggar died, and he was carried away by the angels into Abraham's bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>16:23</a></td><td class=td>他在陰間受痛苦，舉目遠遠的望見亞伯拉罕，又望見拉撒路在他懷裏，<br>And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham from afar and Lazarus in his bosom. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>16:24</a></td><td class=td>就喊著說，我祖亞伯拉罕，可憐我吧，打發拉撒路來，用指頭尖蘸點水，涼涼我的舌頭，因為我在這火焰裏極其痛苦。<br>And he called out and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in this flame. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>16:25</a></td><td class=td>亞伯拉罕說，孩子，你該回想你生前享過福，拉撒路也同樣受過苦；如今他在這裏得安慰，你倒受痛苦。<br>But Abraham said, Child, remember that in your lifetime you fully received your good things, and Lazarus likewise bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>16:26</a></td><td class=td>不但這樣，在我們與你們之間還有深淵隔定，以致人想要從這邊過到你們那邊是不能的，從那邊越過來到我們這邊也是不能的。<br>And besides all these things, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that those wanting to pass from here to you cannot, neither from there to us may any cross over. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>16:27</a></td><td class=td>財主說，我祖啊，既是這樣，求你打發拉撒路到我父家去，<br>And he said, Then I ask you, Father, to send him to the house of my father -- </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>16:28</a></td><td class=td>因為我有五個兄弟，他可以鄭重的向他們作見證，免得他們也來到這痛苦的地方。<br>For I have five brothers -- so that he may solemnly testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>16:29</a></td><td class=td>亞伯拉罕說，他們有摩西和申言者可以聽從。<br>But Abraham said, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>16:30</a></td><td class=td>他說，我祖亞伯拉罕，不是的；若有一位從死裏複活的，到他們那裏去，他們必要悔改。<br>But he said, No, Father Abraham; but if someone risen from the dead would go to them, they will repent. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>16:31</a></td><td class=td>亞伯拉罕說，他們若不聽摩西和申言者，就是有一位從死人中複活的，他們也不會信服。<br>But he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
