<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>4:1</a></td><td class=td>波阿斯上城門去，坐在那裏，恰巧波阿斯所說的那親人經過。波阿斯說，某人哪，你轉過來坐在這裏。他就轉過來坐下。<br>Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat there. And just then the kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken came by. And  Boaz said, Turn aside and sit here,  friend. And he turned aside and sat down.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>4:2</a></td><td class=td>波阿斯又從本城的長老中選取了十個人，對他們說，請你們坐在這裏。他們就都坐下。<br>And he took ten men from among the elders of the city and said, Sit here. And they sat down.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>4:3</a></td><td class=td>波阿斯對那親人說，從摩押鄉間回來的拿俄米，現在要賣我們弟兄以利米勒的那塊田地；<br>And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, who has returned from the country of Moab, has put up for sale the portion of the field that belonged to our brother Elimelech.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>4:4</a></td><td class=td>我想我應當向你表明，說，你可以在這裏坐著的人麵前和我族人的長老麵前買這塊田地。你若肯贖就贖，若不肯贖就告訴我，讓我知道；因為隻有你可以贖，其次就是我。那人回答說，我肯贖。<br>So I thought that I should disclose this to you and say, Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you can redeem it, redeem it; but if you cannot redeem it, tell me so that I will know; for there is no one to redeem it ahead of you, and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>4:5</a></td><td class=td>波阿斯說，你從拿俄米手中買這田地的時候，也當娶死人的妻摩押女子路得，叫死人的名得以在他的產業上存立。<br>Then Boaz said, On the day you buy the field from Naomi's hand,  you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead man, in order to raise up the dead man's name upon his inheritance.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>4:6</a></td><td class=td>那親人說，這樣我自己就不能贖了，恐怕於我的產業有損。你自己可以贖我所當贖的，因我不能贖了。<br>And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, or else I will mar my own inheritance. You redeem for yourself what I should redeem, for I cannot redeem it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>4:7</a></td><td class=td>從前，在以色列中要確立什麼事，或贖回，或交易，這人就脫鞋給那人。以色列中乃是以此為證據。<br>Now such was the custom formerly in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging that to establish any matter a man would draw off his sandal and give it to his neighbor; this was the way of attesting it in Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>4:8</a></td><td class=td>那親人對波阿斯說，你自己買罷；於是將鞋脫下來了。<br>So when the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself, he drew off his sandal.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>4:10</a></td><td class=td>我又娶了瑪倫的妻摩押女子路得為妻，好叫死人的名得以在他的產業上存立，免得死人的名從他的弟兄中，並從他本鄉滅沒。你們今日可以作見證。<br>Furthermore Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I acquire as my own wife so that I may raise up the dead man's name upon his inheritance and the dead man's name may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses today.</td></tr>

May Jehovah make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, the two who built the house of Israel. And prosper in Ephrathah, and gain a name in Bethlehem.</td></tr>
