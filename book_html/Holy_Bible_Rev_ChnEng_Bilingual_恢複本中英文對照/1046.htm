<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>28:4</a></td><td class=td>土人看見那毒蛇懸在他手上，就彼此說，這人必是個凶手，雖然從海裏安全得救，公理還不容他活著。<br>And when the natives saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, whom, though he has been brought safely out of the sea, Justice has not allowed to live. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>28:5</a></td><td class=td>保羅竟把那毒蛇甩在火裏，並沒有受傷。<br>However he shook off the snake into the fire and suffered no harm; </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>28:19</a></td><td class=td>無奈猶太人不服，我才被迫上訴於該撒，並非有什麼事要控告我本國的百姓。<br>But when the Jews spoke against this, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I have anything to accuse my nation of. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>28:20</a></td><td class=td>為這緣故，我懇求你們來見麵談論；我原是為了以色列所盼望的，才戴上這鎖鏈。<br>For this cause therefore, I have entreated you to see me and speak with me; for on account of the hope of Israel I have this chain around me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>28:21</a></td><td class=td>他們對他說，我們並沒有接到從猶太來論你的信，弟兄中也沒有人來報告，或說到你有什麼不好。<br>And they said to him, We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brothers come and reported or spoken anything evil concerning you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>28:22</a></td><td class=td>但我們認為應該聽聽你怎樣想，因為我們曉得，這個教派是到處遭反對的。<br>But we think it is fitting to hear from you what you think, for concerning this sect it is indeed known to us that it is spoken against everywhere. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>28:23</a></td><td class=td>他們和保羅約定了日子，就有更多的人到他的住所來，保羅從早到晚對他們講解，鄭重見證神的國，引摩西的律法和眾申言者的書，以耶穌的事勸服他們。<br>And once they had appointed a day for him, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he expounded these matters, solemnly testifying of the kingdom of God and persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning until evening. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>28:27</a></td><td class=td>因為這百姓心蒙脂油，耳聽不靈，眼睛閉著；恐怕他們眼睛看見，耳朵聽見，心裏領悟，回轉過來，我就醫治他們。”<br>For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and they turn around, and I will heal them.'' </td></tr>
