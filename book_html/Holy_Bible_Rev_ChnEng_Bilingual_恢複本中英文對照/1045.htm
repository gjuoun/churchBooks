<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>27:2</a></td><td class=td>有一隻亞大米田的船，要開往亞西亞沿岸一帶地方，我們上去，船就開行，和我們同去的，還有馬其頓的帖撒羅尼迦人亞裏達古。<br>And going on board an Adramyttian ship which was about to sail to places along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>27:3</a></td><td class=td>第二天，我們在西頓靠了岸，猶流寬待保羅，準他往朋友那裏去，受他們的照應。<br>And on the next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed him to go to his friends to receive care. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>27:4</a></td><td class=td>從那裏又開船，因為風不順，就貼著居比路的背風岸航行。<br>And from there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>27:5</a></td><td class=td>過了基利家、旁非利亞一帶的海，就到了呂家的每拉。<br>And having sailed across the open sea which lies off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down to Myra of Lycia. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>27:6</a></td><td class=td>在那裏，百夫長找到一隻亞力山大的船，要開往義大利去，便叫我們上了那船。<br>And there the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us onto it. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>27:7</a></td><td class=td>一連多日，船行得慢，好不容易到了革尼土一帶，因為被風攔阻，就貼著革哩底的背風岸，從撒摩尼對麵行過。<br>And when we had sailed slowly for a considerable number of days and came with difficulty off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to go on, we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>27:8</a></td><td class=td>我們沿岸航行，好不容易來到一個地方名叫佳澳，離那裏不遠，有拉西亞城。<br>And coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>27:9</a></td><td class=td>過了相當的時候，禁食的節期也過去了，行船又危險，保羅就勸眾人說，<br>And when considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, and also because the Fast had already gone by, Paul advised them, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>27:10</a></td><td class=td>諸位，我看這次航行，不但貨物和船隻要受到傷害，大遭損失，就連我們的性命也難保。<br>Saying to them, Men, I perceive that the voyage is to be with damage and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>27:11</a></td><td class=td>但百夫長寧願信從船長和船主，卻不信從保羅所說的。<br>But the centurion was persuaded by the navigator and the ship's owner rather than by the things that were being said by Paul. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>27:12</a></td><td class=td>且因這港口不適於過冬，大多數的人就主張從那裏開船，或者能到非尼喀過冬。非尼喀是革哩底的一個港口，一麵朝東北，一麵朝東南。<br>And as the harbor was not suitable for wintering, the majority gave counsel to put out to sea from there, if somehow they might be able to reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing northeast and southeast, and spend the winter there. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>27:13</a></td><td class=td>這時微微起了南風，他們以為對目的地已有把握，就起錨，貼近革哩底航行。<br>And when a south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete close inshore. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>27:14</a></td><td class=td>但過了不久，一股名叫友拉革羅的狂風，從島上撲下來，<br>But not long afterward there beat down from the island a hurricane wind called Euraquilo. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>27:15</a></td><td class=td>船被風抓住，敵不住風，我們就任風刮去，<br>And when the ship was caught by it and was not able to face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>27:16</a></td><td class=td>貼著一個小島的背風岸奔航，那島名叫高大，我們好不容易才收住小艇。<br>And running under the shelter of a certain little island called Clauda, we were hardly able to get control of the small boat. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>27:17</a></td><td class=td>既把小艇拉上來，就用纜繩捆綁船底；又恐怕撞在賽耳底沙灘上，就放下帆來，任船飄流。<br>And when they had hoisted it up, they used supports to undergird the ship. And because they feared that they might run aground on Syrtis, they lowered the gear and so were driven along. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>27:18</a></td><td class=td>我們被風浪顛簸得很厲害，第二天眾人就把貨物拋出去，<br>The next day, as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to jettison the cargo; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>27:19</a></td><td class=td>到第三天，他們又親手把船上的用具拋棄了。<br>And on the third day they threw the ship's gear overboard, even with their own hands. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>27:20</a></td><td class=td>太陽和星辰多日不顯露，又有狂風大浪催逼，我們得救的指望就都絕了。<br>And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and while no small storm was assailing us, from then on all hope that we might be saved was being abandoned. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>27:21</a></td><td class=td>眾人多日沒有吃什麼，保羅就站在他們中間，說，諸位，你們本該聽從我，不離開革哩底，免得遭受這樣的傷害和損失。<br>And when they had been a long time without food, Paul then stood in their midst and said, O men, you should have listened to me and not set sail from Crete and gained this damage and loss. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>27:22</a></td><td class=td>現在我還勸你們放心振作，因為你們中間沒有一個人會喪命，惟獨失喪這船，<br>And now I advise you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>27:23</a></td><td class=td>因我所屬所事奉的神，祂的使者昨夜站在我旁邊，說，<br>For this very night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>27:24</a></td><td class=td>保羅，不要害怕，你必站在該撒麵前，看哪，與你同船的人，神都賜給你了。<br>Saying, Do not fear, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>27:25</a></td><td class=td>所以諸位，要放心振作，我信神怎樣對我說，事情也要怎樣成就。<br>Therefore, cheer up, men, for I believe God that it shall be so, even in the way in which it has been spoken to me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>27:26</a></td><td class=td>隻是我們必撞在一個島上。<br>But we must run aground on a certain island. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>27:27</a></td><td class=td>到了第十四天夜裏，我們在亞底亞海飄來飄去，約到半夜，水手以為漸近旱地，<br>But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about the middle of the night the sailors suspected that some land was approaching them. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>27:28</a></td><td class=td>就探探深淺，探得有二十噚；稍往前行，又探探深淺，探得有十五噚。<br>And they took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, they sounded again and found it to be fifteen fathoms. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>27:29</a></td><td class=td>恐怕撞在石頭上，就從船尾拋下四個錨，期待著天亮。<br>And fearing that we might run aground somewhere on rocky places, they threw four anchors from the stern and wished for day to come. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>27:30</a></td><td class=td>水手想要離船逃走，就把小艇放在海裏，假作要從船頭拋錨的樣子。<br>And when the sailors sought to flee from the ship, having lowered the small boat into the sea under pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>27:31</a></td><td class=td>保羅對百夫長和兵丁說，這些人若不留在船上，你們必不能得救。<br>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>27:32</a></td><td class=td>於是兵丁砍斷小艇的繩子，任它飄去。<br>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the small boat and let it fall away. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>27:33</a></td><td class=td>從那時到天快亮，保羅一直勸眾人用飯，說，你們懸望忍餓不吃什麼，今天已是第十四天了。<br>And until day was about to come, Paul encouraged them all to take some food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued watching without food, taking nothing. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>27:34</a></td><td class=td>所以我勸你們用飯，這與你們的得救有關，因為你們各人連一根頭發也不至於損壞。<br>Therefore I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your salvation; for not a hair from the head of any one of you shall perish. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>27:35</a></td><td class=td>保羅說了這話，就拿著餅，在眾人麵前感謝了神，然後擘開來吃。<br>And when he had said these things and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God before all; and he broke it and began to eat. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>27:36</a></td><td class=td>於是眾人都放心振作，也就用飯了。<br>And all became cheerful, and they also took food. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>27:37</a></td><td class=td>我們在船上的，共有二百七十六個人。<br>Now we were in all two hundred and seventy-six souls in the ship. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>27:38</a></td><td class=td>他們吃飽了，就把麥子拋在海裏，叫船輕一點。<br>And when they were satisfied with food, they began to lighten the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>27:39</a></td><td class=td>到了天亮，他們不認識那地方，隻看見一個有岸可登的海灣，就商議能把船攏進去不能。<br>And when day came, they could not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay, which had a beach, into which they took counsel to drive the ship, if they were able. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=40>27:40</a></td><td class=td>於是把錨丟棄在海裏，同時鬆開舵繩，拉起前帆，順著風向岸駛去。<br>And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the bands of the rudders; and hoisting the foresail to the blowing of the wind, they held course for the beach. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=41>27:41</a></td><td class=td>但遇著兩水夾流的地方，就把船擱了淺；船頭膠著不動，船尾被浪猛力衝壞了。<br>But striking a sandbar with the sea on both sides, they ran the vessel aground; and the bow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was broken up by the violence of the waves. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=42>27:42</a></td><td class=td>兵丁的意思是要把囚犯殺了，恐怕有人泅水逃走；<br>And the counsel of the soldiers was that they should kill the prisoners, lest anyone swim away and escape; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=43>27:43</a></td><td class=td>但百夫長願意叫保羅安全得救，不準他們任意而行，就吩咐會泅水的，跳下水去先上岸；<br>But the centurion, intending to bring Paul safely through, prevented them from their intention and ordered those who were able to swim to throw themselves overboard first and get to the land, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=44>27:44</a></td><td class=td>其餘的人，有的可以用木板，有的可以用船上的東西上岸。這樣，眾人都安全得救上了岸。<br>And the rest to follow, some on planks, and others on some of the things from the ship.
