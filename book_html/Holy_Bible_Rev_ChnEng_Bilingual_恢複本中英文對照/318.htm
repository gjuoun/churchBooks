<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>5:1</a></td><td class=td>亞蘭王的元帥乃縵，在他主人麵前為大，極受尊寵，因耶和華曾藉他使亞蘭人得勝；他又是大能的勇士，隻是患了痲瘋。<br>Now Naaman, the captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man in the sight of his master and highly respected, because by him Jehovah had given deliverance to Syria. But the man, though a mighty man of valor, was a leper.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>5:2</a></td><td class=td>先前亞蘭人結隊出去，從以色列地擄了一個小女子，她就在乃縵的妻子麵前伺候她。<br>And the Syrians had gone out in bands and had taken captive a little girl from the land of Israel, and she waited on Naaman's wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>5:3</a></td><td class=td>她對主母說，巴不得我主人在撒瑪利亞的申言者麵前，那麼，他必能治好主人的痲瘋。<br>And she said to her mistress, If only my master were  with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his leprosy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>5:4</a></td><td class=td>乃縵進去，告訴他主人說，從以色列地來的女子如此如此說。<br>And Naaman went in and told his master, saying, Thus and thus did the girl who is from the land of Israel say.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>5:5</a></td><td class=td>亞蘭王說，你可以去，我也會送信給以色列王。於是乃縵手中帶著銀子十他連得，金子六千舍客勒，衣裳十套，就去了；<br>Then the king of Syria said, Go then, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he went and took  with him ten talents of silver and six thousand shekels of gold and ten changes of clothes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>5:6</a></td><td class=td>且帶信給以色列王，信上說，現在這信到了你那裏，你就知道我打發臣仆乃縵去見你，是要你治好他的痲瘋。<br>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read: And now, when this letter comes to you, I am sending Naaman my servant to you, that you may cure him of his leprosy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>5:7</a></td><td class=td>以色列王讀了信就撕裂衣服，說，我豈是神，能使人死、使人活呢？這人竟打發人來，叫我治好一個人的痲瘋。你們留意，看看這人是怎樣尋隙攻擊我。<br>And when the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, Am I God to put to death and to give life, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Therefore consider now and see how he seeks an occasion against me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>5:8</a></td><td class=td>神人以利沙聽見以色列王撕裂衣服，就打發人去見王，說，你為什麼撕了衣服呢？可以使那人到我這裏來，他就知道以色列中有申言者了。<br>And when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent word to the king, saying, Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>5:9</a></td><td class=td>於是，乃縵帶著車馬來了，站在以利沙的家門口。<br>And Naaman came with his horses and his chariot and stood at the entrance of the house of Elisha.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>5:10</a></td><td class=td>以利沙打發一個使者，對乃縵說，你去在約但河中沐浴七次，你的肉必複原，你就必得潔淨。<br>And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be  restored; and you shall be clean.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>5:11</a></td><td class=td>乃縵卻發怒走了，說，我想他必定出來見我，站著呼求耶和華他神的名，在患處以上搖手，治好這痲瘋。<br>But Naaman became furious and went away and said, I thought, He will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the place and cure the leper.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>5:12</a></td><td class=td>大馬色的河亞罷拿和法珥法，豈不比以色列的一切水更好麼？我不能在那裏沐浴，得潔淨麼？於是氣忿忿的轉身去了。<br>Are not the  Abana and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>5:13</a></td><td class=td>他的仆人進前來，對他說，我父阿，申言者若叫你作一件大事，你豈不作麼？何況說你去沐浴而得潔淨呢？<br>And his servants came near and spoke to him and said, My father, had the prophet told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he says to you, Wash and be clean?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>5:14</a></td><td class=td>於是乃縵下去，照著神人的話，在約但河裏浸了七次。他的肉複原，好像小孩子的肉，他就潔淨了。<br>So he went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times according to the word of the man of God. And his flesh was restored to be like the flesh of a little boy, and he was clean.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>5:15</a></td><td class=td>乃縵帶著一切跟隨他的人，回到神人那裏；他進去，站在他麵前，說，如今我知道，除了在以色列之外，全地並沒有神。現在求你收下仆人的禮物。<br>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came and stood before him and said, Now I know that there is no God in all the earth except with Israel. And now, please accept a present from your servant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>5:16</a></td><td class=td>以利沙說，我指著永活的耶和華，就是我侍立在祂麵前的那位起誓，我必不接受。<br>But he said, As Jehovah lives, before whom I stand, I will receive nothing. And Naaman urged him to take it, but he refused.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>5:17</a></td><td class=td>乃縵再三的求他，他卻不接受。乃縵說，你若不肯接受，請將兩騾子馱的土賜給你仆人，因你仆人必不再將燔祭或平安祭獻與別神，隻獻給耶和華。<br>And Naaman said, Then if not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth, for your servant will no more offer burnt offerings and sacrifices to other gods, but to Jehovah only.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>5:18</a></td><td class=td>惟有這件事，願耶和華饒恕你仆人：我主人進臨門廟叩拜的時候，我用手攙他，我在臨門廟也就叩拜。我在臨門廟叩拜的這事，願耶和華饒恕仆人。<br>In this matter may Jehovah pardon your servant: When my master goes into the house of Rimmon to bow down there and leans on my arm, and I bow down in the house of Rimmon, when I bow down in the house of Rimmon, may Jehovah pardon your servant in this matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>5:19</a></td><td class=td>以利沙對他說，你平平安安的去罷。乃縵離開他走了不遠，<br>And he said to him, Go in peace. And when he had gone from him a little way,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>5:20</a></td><td class=td>神人以利沙的仆人基哈西心裏說，我主人白白放過這亞蘭人乃縵，不從他手裏受他帶來的禮物，我指著永活的耶和華起誓，我必跑去追上他，向他要些東西。<br>Gehazi, the attendant of Elisha the man of God said, Now my master has spared Naaman this Syrian by not receiving from his hand that which he brought. As Jehovah lives, I will run after him and take something from him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>5:21</a></td><td class=td>於是基哈西追趕乃縵。乃縵看見有人追趕，就急忙下車迎著他，說，都平安麼？<br>So Gehazi pursued Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him and said, Is all well?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>5:22</a></td><td class=td>他說，都平安。我主人打發我來說，剛才有兩個少年人，是申言者的門徒，從以法蓮山地來見我；請你賜他們一他連得銀子，兩套衣裳。<br>And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Now at this moment two young men from among the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim; please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>5:23</a></td><td class=td>乃縵說，請接受二他連得。他再三的促請基哈西，並將二他連得銀子包在兩個口袋裏，連同兩套衣裳，交給兩個仆人；他們就在基哈西前頭抬著走。<br>And Naaman said, Please take two talents. And he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothes, and gave them to two of his attendants; and they carried them before him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>5:24</a></td><td class=td>到了山岡，基哈西從他們手中接過來，存放在屋裏；然後打發他們離去，他們就走了。<br>And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand and deposited them in the house. And he sent the men away, and they departed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>5:25</a></td><td class=td>基哈西進去，站在他主人麵前。以利沙問他說，基哈西，你從那裏來？他說，仆人沒有往那裏去。<br>And he went in and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, Where have you come from, Gehazi? And he said, Your servant has not gone anywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>5:26</a></td><td class=td>以利沙對他說，那人下車轉回迎你的時候，我的心豈沒有去呢？這豈是接受銀子和衣裳，買橄欖園、葡萄園、牛羊、仆婢的時候呢？<br>And he said to him, Did not my heart go with you when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive silver and to receive clothing and olive groves and vineyards and sheep and oxen and male servants and female servants?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>5:27</a></td><td class=td>因此，乃縵的痲瘋必沾附於你和你的後裔，直到永遠。基哈西從以利沙麵前出去，就患了痲瘋，像雪那樣白。<br>Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cleave to you and to your seed forever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
