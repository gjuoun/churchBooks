<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>51:2</a></td><td class=td>要仰望你們的祖宗亞伯拉罕，和為你們受生產之苦的撒拉；因為亞伯拉罕獨自一人的時候，我呼召了他，賜福與他，使他人數增多。<br>Look to Abraham your father, And to Sarah who travailed with you; For I called him when he was one person, And blessed him and multiplied him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>51:3</a></td><td class=td>耶和華已經安慰錫安；祂已經安慰錫安一切的荒場，使她的曠野像伊甸，使她的沙漠像耶和華的園子。在其中必有歡喜、快樂、感謝、和歌唱的聲音。<br>For Jehovah has comforted Zion; He has comforted all her waste places, And made her wilderness like Eden, And her desert like the garden of Jehovah. Gladness and joy will be found in her,  Thanksgiving and the voice of song.</td></tr>

But where is the fury of the oppressor?</td></tr>
