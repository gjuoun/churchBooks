<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>9:1</a></td><td class=td>這樣，第一約的確有敬拜的章則，和屬世界的聖幕。<br>Now then the first covenant also had ordinances of service, and its sanctuary was of this world. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>9:2</a></td><td class=td>因為有預備好的帳幕，頭一層叫作聖所，裏麵有燈台、桌子和陳設餅；<br>For a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which were the lampstand and the table and the loaves that were set forth, which is called the Holy Place; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>9:3</a></td><td class=td>第二幔子後，還有一層帳幕，叫作至聖所，<br>And after the second veil, a tabernacle, which is called the Holy of Holies, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>9:4</a></td><td class=td>有金香壇，和四麵包金的約櫃，櫃裏有盛嗎哪的金罐、和亞倫發過芽的杖、並兩塊約版；<br>Having a golden altar and the ark of the covenant covered about everywhere with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna and Aaron's rod that budded and the tablets of the covenant, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>9:5</a></td><td class=td>櫃上麵有榮耀的基路伯覆蔭著平息處；關於這幾件，現在不能一一細說。<br>And above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the propitiation place, concerning which it is not now the time to speak in detail. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>9:6</a></td><td class=td>這些物件都這樣預備好了，眾祭司就常常進入頭一層帳幕，完成敬拜；<br>Now these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle the priests enter continually, accomplishing their worship; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>9:7</a></td><td class=td>至於第二層帳幕，隻有大祭司一年一次獨自進去，沒有不帶著血，為自己和百姓誤犯的罪獻上的；<br>But into the second, only the high priest enters, once a year and not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of ignorance of the people, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>9:8</a></td><td class=td>聖靈如此指明，當頭一層帳幕仍然存立的時候，至聖所的路還未顯明；<br>The Holy Spirit thus making this clear, that the way of the Holy of Holies has not yet been manifested while the first tabernacle still has its standing, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>9:9</a></td><td class=td>那頭一層帳幕作現今時期的一個象征，按這象征所獻的禮物和祭物，就著良心說，都不能叫敬拜的人得以完全；<br>Which is a figure for the present time. According to this tabernacle both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are unable to perfect, according to conscience, him who worships, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>9:10</a></td><td class=td>這些不過是在於飲食和各樣的浸洗，都是屬肉體的章則，製定到更正的時期。<br>Consisting only of foods and drinks and various washings, being ordinances of the flesh, imposed until the time of setting things right. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>9:11</a></td><td class=td>但基督已經來到，作了那已經實現之美事的大祭司，經過那更大、更全備的帳幕，不是人手所造的，就是不屬這受造世界的；<br>But Christ, having come as a High Priest of the good things that have come into being, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made by hands, that is, not of this creation, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>9:12</a></td><td class=td>並且不是藉著山羊和牛犢的血，乃是藉著祂自己的血，一次永遠的進入至聖所，便得到了永遠的救贖。<br>And not through the blood of goats and calves but through His own blood, entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, obtaining an eternal redemption. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>9:13</a></td><td class=td>若山羊和公牛的血，並母牛犢的灰，灑在汙穢的人身上，尚且使人聖別，以致人的肉身得著潔淨，<br>For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who are defiled sanctify to the purity of the flesh, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>9:14</a></td><td class=td>何況基督藉著永遠的靈，將自己無瑕無疵的獻給神，祂的血豈不更潔淨我們的良心，使其脫離死行，叫我們事奉活神麼？<br>How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>9:15</a></td><td class=td>所以，祂作了新約的中保，既然受死，贖了人在第一約之下的過犯，便叫蒙召之人得著所應許永遠的產業。<br>And because of this He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>9:16</a></td><td class=td>凡有遺命，立遺命者的死必須證實出來；<br>For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>9:17</a></td><td class=td>因為留遺命的人死了，遺命才得確定；立遺命的人還活著的時候，遺命是沒有效力的。<br>For a testament is confirmed in the case of the dead, since it never has force when he who made the testament is living. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>9:18</a></td><td class=td>所以第一約也不是不用血創立的。<br>Hence neither was the first covenant initiated without blood; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>9:19</a></td><td class=td>因為各條誡命既由摩西照著律法，向眾百姓講過了，他就拿牛犢和山羊的血，用水和朱紅色絨並牛膝草，灑在那約書上，並眾百姓身上，說，<br>For when every commandment according to the law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll of the covenant itself and all the people, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>9:20</a></td><td class=td>“這就是神與你們所立之約的血。”<br>Saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded to you.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>9:21</a></td><td class=td>他又照樣把血灑在帳幕和一切敬拜用的器皿上。<br>And both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service he sprinkled in like manner with the blood. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>9:22</a></td><td class=td>按著律法，凡物差不多都是用血潔淨的，沒有流血，就沒有赦罪。<br>And almost all things are purified by blood according to the law, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>9:23</a></td><td class=td>所以，諸天上之物的樣本，必須用這些祭物去潔淨；但那天上之物的本身，必須用比這些更美的祭物去潔淨。<br>It was necessary therefore for the examples of the things in the heavens to be purified by these, but the heavenly things themselves, by better sacrifices than these. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>9:24</a></td><td class=td>因為基督並不是進入人手所造的聖所，那不過是真聖所的複本，乃是進入了天的本身，如今為我們顯在神麵前；<br>For Christ did not enter into a holy place made by hands, a figure of the true, but into heaven itself, to appear now before the face of God for us; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>9:25</a></td><td class=td>祂也不是多次將自己獻上，像那大祭司每年帶著牛羊的血進入至聖所；<br>Nor in order that He might offer Himself often, just as the high priest enters into the Holy of Holies year by year by the blood of other creatures; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>9:26</a></td><td class=td>如果這樣，從創世以來，祂就必須多次受苦了；但如今祂在諸世代的終結顯明了一次，好藉著獻上自己為祭，把罪除掉。<br>Since then He would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>9:27</a></td><td class=td>按著定命，人人都有一死，死後且有審判；<br>And inasmuch as it is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>9:28</a></td><td class=td>基督也是這樣，既一次被獻，擔當了多人的罪，將來還要向那熱切等待祂的人第二次顯現，並與罪無關，乃為拯救他們。<br>So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
