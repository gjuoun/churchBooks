<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>24:21</a></td><td class=td>縱然有，也不過是為了我站在他們中間所喊的這一聲：我今日在你們麵前受審，是為死人複活。<br>Other than concerning this one sound which I cried out while standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged today before you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>24:22</a></td><td class=td>腓力斯既更加詳確的曉得關於這道路的事，就拖延他們，說，且等千夫長呂西亞下來，我要審斷你們的事。<br>But Felix, knowing more accurately the things concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the commander comes down, I will determine your affairs. </td></tr>
