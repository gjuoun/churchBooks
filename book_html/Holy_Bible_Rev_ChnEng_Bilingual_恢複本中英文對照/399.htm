And he encamped against the fortified cities and intended to break into them for himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>32:2</a></td><td class=td>希西家見西拿基立來，定意要攻打耶路撒冷，<br>And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that his face was set to fight against Jerusalem,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>32:3</a></td><td class=td>就與首領和勇士商議，塞住城外的水泉；他們就都幫助他。<br>He took counsel with his officers and mighty men to stop the water of the fountains that were outside the city, and they helped him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>32:4</a></td><td class=td>於是有許多人聚集，塞了一切水泉，並通流那地的小河，說，亞述諸王來，為何讓他們得著許多水呢？<br>So many people gathered together and stopped all the fountains and the brook that flowed through the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come and find an abundance of water?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>32:5</a></td><td class=td>希西家奮勇自強，修築所有拆毀的城牆，在城牆上立起城樓，並且在城外另築一城牆；他又堅固大衛城的米羅，製造了許多兵器、盾牌。<br>And he took courage and built up all the wall that was broken down and  erected towers on it and built another wall outside; and he strengthened the Millo in the city of David and made weapons and shields in abundance.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>32:7</a></td><td class=td>你們當剛強壯膽，不要因亞述王和跟隨他的所有軍眾懼怕、驚惶，因為與我們同在的，比與他們同在的更大：<br>Be strong and be bold; do not be afraid or dismayed because of the king of Assyria or because of all the multitude that is with him, for there is Someone greater with us than with him:</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>32:8</a></td><td class=td>與他們同在的是肉臂，與我們同在的卻是耶和華我們的神，祂幫助我們，為我們爭戰。百姓就靠猶大王希西家的話，安然無懼了。<br>With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles. And the people relied on the words of Hezekiah the king of Judah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>32:9</a></td><td class=td>此後，亞述王西拿基立和他的全軍攻打拉吉，就差遣臣仆到耶路撒冷，見猶大王希西家和一切在耶路撒冷的猶大人，說，<br>After this Sennacherib the king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem-now he was before Lachish and all his forces were with him-to Hezekiah the king of Judah and to all Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>32:10</a></td><td class=td>亞述王西拿基立如此說，你們倚靠什麼，還留在耶路撒冷受困呢？<br>Thus says Sennacherib the king of Assyria, In what are you trusting, that you remain in a siege in Jerusalem?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>32:11</a></td><td class=td>希西家對你們說，耶和華我們的神必救我們脫離亞述王的手，這不是誘勸你們，使你們受饑渴而死麼？<br>Is not Hezekiah trying to persuade you to give yourselves up to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>32:12</a></td><td class=td>這希西家豈不是曾將耶和華的邱壇和祭壇廢去，且吩咐猶大與耶路撒冷的人說，你們當在一個壇前敬拜，在其上燒香麼？<br>Was it not the same Hezekiah who took away His high places and His altars and who commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Before one altar you shall worship, and upon it shall you burn incense?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>32:13</a></td><td class=td>我與我列祖向各地眾民所行的，你們豈不知道麼？各地列邦的神何嚐能救自己的地脫離我的手呢？<br>Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands at all able to deliver their land out of my hand?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>32:15</a></td><td class=td>所以現在不要讓希西家這樣欺哄誘勸你們，也不要信他；因為沒有任何一邦一國的神，能救自己的民脫離我的手和我列祖的手；何況你們的神，更不能救你們脫離我的手！<br>Now therefore do not let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this way, and do not believe him; for there is no god of any nation or kingdom who was able to deliver his people out of my hand and out of the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>32:16</a></td><td class=td>西拿基立的臣仆還說了別的話，攻擊耶和華神和祂的仆人希西家。<br>And his servants said still more against Jehovah God and against Hezekiah His servant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>32:17</a></td><td class=td>西拿基立也寫信辱罵耶和華以色列的神，攻擊祂，說，各地列邦的神怎樣不能救自己的民脫離我的手，希西家的神也照樣不能救自己的民脫離我的手。<br>And he wrote letters to cast contempt on Jehovah the God of Israel and to speak against Him, saying, Like the gods of the nations of the lands that did not deliver their people out of my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people out of my hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>32:18</a></td><td class=td>亞述王的臣仆用猶大語向城牆上耶路撒冷的民大聲呼叫，要使他們懼怕、驚惶，以便取城。<br>And they cried out in a loud voice in the Jews' language against the people of Jerusalem who were upon the wall in order to frighten them and terrify them, so that they might take the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>32:19</a></td><td class=td>他們說話攻擊耶路撒冷的神，如同攻擊地上諸民的神，就是人手所造的神一樣。<br>And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem as they had against the gods of the peoples of the land, the work of men's hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>32:20</a></td><td class=td>希西家王和亞摩斯的兒子申言者以賽亞為此禱告，向天呼求。<br>But Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed about this, and they cried out to heaven.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>32:21</a></td><td class=td>耶和華就差遣一個使者，把亞述王營中所有大能的勇士、首領和將帥，盡都滅了。亞述王滿麵含羞的回到他的本地，進了他神的廟中，他親生的幾個兒子在那裏用刀殺了他。<br>And Jehovah sent an angel, who annihilated all the mighty men of valor and the leaders and the captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he entered the house of his god, some of those who had come forth from his bowels felled him there with the sword.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>32:22</a></td><td class=td>這樣，耶和華救了希西家和耶路撒冷的居民，脫離亞述王西拿基立的手，也脫離一切仇敵的手，並且四圍護衛了他們。<br>Thus Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem out of the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and out of the hand of everyone, and He  protected them on all sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>32:23</a></td><td class=td>有許多人到耶路撒冷，將供物獻與耶和華，又將寶物送給猶大王希西家，以致希西家從此在列邦人的眼中看為尊高。<br>And many brought gifts to Jehovah at Jerusalem and precious things to Hezekiah the king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all the nations thereafter.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>32:24</a></td><td class=td>那些日子，希西家病得要死，就禱告耶和華；耶和華對他說話，賜他一個兆頭。<br>In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill, and he prayed to Jehovah. And He spoke to him and gave him a sign.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>32:25</a></td><td class=td>希西家卻沒有照他所受的好處報答耶和華，因他心裏高傲；故此忿怒要臨到他和猶大並耶路撒冷。<br>But Hezekiah did not respond according to the benefit  he had received, for his heart was  proud; therefore wrath came upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>32:26</a></td><td class=td>但希西家和耶路撒冷的居民自覺心裏高傲，就一同自卑，以致耶和華的忿怒在希西家的日子，沒有臨到他們。<br>But Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah did not come again upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>32:27</a></td><td class=td>希西家大有財富和尊榮，為自己建造府庫，收藏金銀、寶石、香料、盾牌、和各樣的珍寶；<br>Now Hezekiah had very much wealth and honor, and he made for himself treasuries for silver and gold and precious stones and for spices and shields and all kinds of valuable goods,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>32:28</a></td><td class=td>又建造倉房，收藏所出產的五穀、新酒和新油，又為各類牲口蓋棚，為羊群築圈。<br>As well as storehouses for produce of grain and new wine and fresh oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and flocks in sheepfolds.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>32:29</a></td><td class=td>並且為自己建造城邑，還獲得許多的羊群牛群，因為神賜他極多的財產。<br>And he built cities and acquired many flocks and herds, for God had given him very many possessions.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>32:30</a></td><td class=td>這希西家也塞住基訓水流的上泉，引水直下，流在大衛城的西邊。希西家所作的事盡都亨通。<br>And it was this Hezekiah who stopped the upper spring of the water of Gihon and directed it down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>32:31</a></td><td class=td>惟有一件事，就是巴比倫王侯的使者奉差遣來見希西家，訪問那地所發生的奇事；在這件事上神離棄他，要試驗他，好知道他心中的一切。<br>So also in the matter of the envoys of the princes of Babylon, who had been sent to him to inquire about the wonders that had happened in the land, God forsook him only to test him and know all that was in his heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>32:32</a></td><td class=td>希西家其餘的事和他所行忠信的事，都寫在猶大、以色列的諸王記上，亞摩斯的兒子申言者以賽亞的異象書中。<br>And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his deeds of faithfulness are there written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>32:33</a></td><td class=td>希西家與他列祖同睡，人將他葬在大衛子孫墓地的高坡；他死的時候，猶大眾人和耶路撒冷的居民，都向他致敬。他兒子瑪拿西接續他作王。<br>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper part of the tombs of David's sons; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him when he died. And Manasseh his son reigned in his place.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
