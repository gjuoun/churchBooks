<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>13:1</a></td><td class=td>那時，有一個神人憑耶和華的話從猶大來到伯特利；耶羅波安正站在壇旁要燒香。<br>And at that moment there came a man of God from Judah by the word of Jehovah to Bethel while Jeroboam was standing at the altar to burn incense.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>13:2</a></td><td class=td>神人憑耶和華的話向壇呼叫，說，壇哪，壇哪，耶和華如此說，看哪，大衛家必生一個兒子，名叫約西亞；他必將邱壇的祭司，就是在你上麵燒香的，宰殺在你上麵作祭物，將人的骨頭燒在你上麵。<br>And he cried out against the altar by the word of Jehovah and said, Altar, O altar, thus says Jehovah: Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and he will sacrifice upon you the priests of the high places who burn incense upon you, and men's bones will they burn upon you.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>13:4</a></td><td class=td>耶羅波安王聽見神人向伯特利的壇所呼叫的話，就從壇上伸手，說，拿住他！王向神人所伸的手就枯幹了，不能收回；<br>And when the king heard the word of the man of God that he cried out against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from over the altar, saying, Lay hold of him! And his hand, which he had stretched out against him, withered, and he could not draw it back to himself.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>13:17</a></td><td class=td>因為有耶和華的話對我說，你在那裏不可吃飯喝水，也不可從你去的原路回來。<br>For I was told by the word of Jehovah, You shall not eat food nor drink water there, nor shall you return by going on the way that you came there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>13:18</a></td><td class=td>老申言者對他說，我也是申言者，和你一樣；有天使憑耶和華的話對我說，你去把他帶回你的家，叫他吃飯喝水。這都是老申言者誆哄他。<br>And the old man said, I also am a prophet like you, and an angel has spoken to me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Bring him back with you to your house that he may eat food and drink water. He lied to him.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>13:23</a></td><td class=td>吃飯喝水之後，老申言者為所帶回來的申言者備驢。<br>And after he had eaten food and had drunk water, the old man saddled the donkey for him, that is, for the prophet whom he had brought back.</td></tr>
