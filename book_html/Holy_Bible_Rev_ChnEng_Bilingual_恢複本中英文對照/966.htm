<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>9:5</a></td><td class=td>彼得對耶穌說，拉比，我們在這裏真好，可以搭三座帳棚，一座為你，一座為摩西，一座為以利亞。<br>And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>9:6</a></td><td class=td>彼得不知道該說什麼才好，因為他們甚是懼怕。<br>For he did not know what to answer, for they had become extremely frightened. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>9:12</a></td><td class=td>耶穌說，以利亞固然要先來複興萬事。怎麼經上又記著，人子要受許多的苦，且被人視為無有？<br>And He said to them, Elijah does indeed come first and restore all things.
