<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>7:2</a></td><td class=td>在這第二天的酒筵中，王又問以斯帖說，王後以斯帖阿，你要什麼？我必賜給你。你求什麼？就是國的一半，也必為你成就。<br>And the king said again unto Esther on the second day during the banquet of wine, What is your petition, Queen Esther? And it shall be granted to you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom it shall be done.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>7:3</a></td><td class=td>王後以斯帖回答說，王阿，我若在你眼前蒙恩，王若以為美，我所要的是王將我的性命賜給我，我所求的是王將我的本族賜給我；<br>Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me as my petition, and that of my people as my request;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>7:4</a></td><td class=td>因我和我的本族被賣了，要被殲毀，殺戮滅絕。我們若僅僅被賣為奴為婢，我也閉口不言，因為不值得叫王因敵人受攪擾。<br>For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. And if we had been sold as slaves, men and women, I would have remained silent, for the adversary is not worth the annoyance to the king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>7:5</a></td><td class=td>亞哈隨魯王問王後以斯帖說，擅敢起意如此行的是誰？這人在那裏？<br>Then King Ahasuerus spoke and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, who presumes to do so?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>7:6</a></td><td class=td>以斯帖說，敵人仇人就是這惡人哈曼。哈曼在王和王後麵前就甚驚惶。<br>And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, this wicked Haman. Then Haman became terrified before the king and the queen.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>7:7</a></td><td class=td>於是王在怒中起來，離開酒席往王宮的花園去了；哈曼見王定意要加禍處罰他，就起來，求王後以斯帖救命。<br>And the king arose in his anger from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden, and Haman stood up to make a request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that harm had been determined against him by the king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>7:8</a></td><td class=td>王從王宮花園回到酒筵的宮內，哈曼正伏在以斯帖所靠的榻上。王說，他竟敢在這宮內，在我麵前淩辱王後麼？這話一出王口，人就蒙了哈曼的臉。<br>And when the king returned from the palace garden into the house of the banquet of wine, Haman was prostrate on the couch where Esther was.
