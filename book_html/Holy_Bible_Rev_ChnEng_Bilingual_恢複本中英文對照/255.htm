<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>19:1</a></td><td class=td>掃羅對他兒子約拿單和眾臣仆說，要殺大衛；掃羅的兒子約拿單卻甚喜愛大衛。<br>And Saul told Jonathan his son and all his servants to kill David. But Jonathan, Saul's son, took great delight in David.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>19:2</a></td><td class=td>約拿單告訴大衛說，我父親掃羅想要殺你，所以明日早晨你要小心，留在隱密的地方，躲藏起來。<br>And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father is seeking to kill you. Now therefore be on guard in the morning, and stay in some secret place, and hide yourself.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>19:3</a></td><td class=td>我就出到你躲藏的田裏，站在我父親旁邊，與他談論你的事；我看看情形怎樣，就必告訴你。<br>And I will go out and stand by my father's side in the field where you are. And I will speak about you to my father; and if I learn anything, I will tell you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>19:4</a></td><td class=td>約拿單向他父親掃羅說大衛的好話，說，王不可得罪王的仆人大衛，因為他未曾得罪你，他所行的都與你大有益處。<br>So Jonathan spoke well about David to Saul his father and said to him, May the king not sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have been very good for you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>19:5</a></td><td class=td>他不顧性命殺那非利士人，耶和華就為全以色列大行拯救；那時你看見，也很歡喜，現在為何無故要殺大衛，犯流無辜人之血的罪呢？<br>For he risked his life when he struck down the Philistine, and Jehovah accomplished a great salvation for all Israel. You saw  it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by having David killed without cause?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>19:6</a></td><td class=td>掃羅聽了約拿單的話，就起誓說，我指著永活的耶和華起誓，他必不至被處死。<br>And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan; and Saul swore, As Jehovah lives, he shall not be put to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>19:7</a></td><td class=td>約拿單叫大衛來，把這一切事告訴他，約拿單帶大衛去見掃羅，他就和以前一樣，侍立在掃羅麵前。<br>Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>19:8</a></td><td class=td>此後又有爭戰的事。大衛出去與非利士人打仗，大大殺敗他們，他們就從他麵前逃跑。<br>And there was war again. And David went out and fought against the Philistines. And he struck them with a great slaughter, and they fled from before him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>19:9</a></td><td class=td>從耶和華那裏來的惡靈又降在掃羅身上；掃羅手裏拿槍坐在屋裏，大衛正用手彈琴。<br>Then there came an evil spirit from Jehovah upon Saul, and he sat in his house with his spear in his hand while David played  the lyre by hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>19:10</a></td><td class=td>掃羅用槍想要刺透大衛，釘在牆上；他卻從掃羅麵前躲開，掃羅的槍刺入牆內。當夜大衛逃走躲避了。<br>And Saul sought to strike David even to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away from Saul's presence. And Saul struck the wall with his spear, but David fled and escaped that night.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>19:11</a></td><td class=td>掃羅打發使者去大衛的房屋那裏窺探他，要在第二天早晨殺他。大衛的妻子米甲對他說，你今夜若不逃命，明日你要被殺。<br>Then Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him and kill him in the morning. And Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, If you do not save your life tonight, in the morning you will be killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>19:12</a></td><td class=td>於是米甲將大衛從窗戶裏縋下去；大衛就離去，逃走躲避了。<br>So Michal let David down through the window, and he went away and fled and escaped.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>19:13</a></td><td class=td>米甲把家中的神像放在床上，把山羊毛織的網子放在像的頭上，用衣服遮蓋。<br>Then Michal took the teraphim and laid  it in the bed. And she put a net of goats' hair on its head and covered  it with clothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>19:14</a></td><td class=td>掃羅打發使者去捉拿大衛，米甲說，他病了。<br>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>19:15</a></td><td class=td>掃羅又打發使者去看大衛，說，當連床將他抬上我這裏來，我好殺他。<br>And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me on his bed that I may kill him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>19:16</a></td><td class=td>使者進去，看見床上有神像，頭上有山羊毛織的網子。<br>And when the messengers went in, there was the teraphim in the bed with a net of goats' hair on its head.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>19:17</a></td><td class=td>掃羅對米甲說，你為什麼這樣欺哄我，放走我的仇敵，使他逃脫呢？米甲對掃羅說，他對我說，你放我走，何必要我殺你呢？<br>Then Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go so that he has slipped away? And Michal said to Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I kill you?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>19:18</a></td><td class=td>大衛逃走脫身，來到拉瑪見撒母耳，將掃羅向他所行的事都述說了。他和撒母耳就往拿約去居住。<br>So David fled and slipped away and came to Samuel at Ramah, and he told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt at Naioth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>19:19</a></td><td class=td>有人告訴掃羅說，大衛在拉瑪的拿約。<br>Then it was told Saul, saying, David is now at Naioth in Ramah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>19:20</a></td><td class=td>掃羅打發使者去捉拿大衛。去的人見有一班申言者正在申言，撒母耳站著監管他們；神的靈臨到掃羅的使者身上，他們就也申言。<br>So Saul sent messengers to seize David; and when they saw the company of prophets prophesying and Samuel standing  and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came upon Saul's messengers, and they also prophesied.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>19:21</a></td><td class=td>有人將這事告訴掃羅，他又打發別的使者去，他們也申言。掃羅第三次再打發使者去，他們也申言。<br>And it was told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul again sent messengers the third time, and they also prophesied.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>19:22</a></td><td class=td>然後掃羅自己也往拉瑪去，到了西沽的大井，問人說，撒母耳和大衛在那裏？有人說，在拉瑪的拿約。<br>Then he himself went to Ramah. And he came to the great well that is in Secu; and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And someone said, They are now at Naioth in Ramah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>19:23</a></td><td class=td>他就往拉瑪的拿約去。神的靈也臨到他身上，他就一麵走一麵申言，直到拉瑪的拿約。<br>So he went there, toward Naioth in Ramah. And the Spirit of God came upon him as well, and he went on and prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>19:24</a></td><td class=td>他也脫了衣服，並且在撒母耳麵前申言，那一晝一夜露體躺臥。因此有話說，掃羅也在申言者中間麼？<br>And he also stripped off his clothes and also prophesied before Samuel, and he lay naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
