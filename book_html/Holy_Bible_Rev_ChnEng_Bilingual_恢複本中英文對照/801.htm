<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>4:1</a></td><td class=td>黃金何竟失光！極純的金何竟變色！聖所的石頭倒在各街頭上。<br>How the gold has become dim! How the most pure gold has changed! The stones of the sanctuary lie poured out At the head of every street.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>4:2</a></td><td class=td>錫安寶貴的眾子，好比精金，現在何竟算為窯匠的手所作的瓦瓶。<br>The precious sons of Zion, Comparable to fine gold, How they are esteemed as earthen pitchers, The work of the hands of a potter.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>4:3</a></td><td class=td>野狗尚且把奶乳哺崽子，我民的女子倒成為殘忍，好像曠野的鴕鳥一般。<br>Even the jackals present the breast; They nurse their young ones; But the daughter of my people has become cruel, Like the ostriches in the  wilderness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>4:4</a></td><td class=td>吃奶孩子的舌頭，因幹渴貼住上膛；孩童求餅，無人擘給他們。<br>The tongue of the sucking child cleaves To the roof of his mouth for thirst; The little ones ask for bread, But no one breaks it for them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>4:5</a></td><td class=td>素來吃美好食物的，現今在街上變為淒涼；素來在朱紅褥子中養大的，現今抱臥糞堆；<br>Those who fed on delicacies Are desolate in the streets; Those who were brought up in  scarlet Embrace dung heaps.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>4:6</a></td><td class=td>我民的罪孽，比所多瑪的罪還大；所多瑪雖然無人加手於她，還是轉眼之間被傾覆。<br>And the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater Than the sin of Sodom, Which was overthrown as in a moment; And no hands were laid on her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>4:7</a></td><td class=td>錫安的貴胄素來比雪純淨，比奶更白；他們的身體比珊瑚更紅，樣貌像藍寶石一樣。<br>Her nobles were purer than snow; They were whiter than milk; They were redder in body than  corals; Their figure was like sapphire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>4:8</a></td><td class=td>現在他們的麵貌比黑炭更黑，以致在街上無人認識；他們的皮膚緊貼骨頭，枯幹如同木柴。<br>Their visage is darker than black  coal; They are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled up on their bones; It has dried up; it has become like wood.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>4:9</a></td><td class=td>餓死的不如被刀殺的，因為他們缺乏田間的出產，就受折磨，漸漸消瘦死亡。<br>Those who were slain by the sword are better Than those slain by famine; For these pine away stricken through, Because of the lack of the produce of the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>4:10</a></td><td class=td>慈憐的婦人親手煮自己的兒女；當我民被毀滅的時候，他們的兒女成了自己的食物。<br>The hands of compassionate women Have boiled their own children; They have become their food In the destruction of the daughter of my people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>4:11</a></td><td class=td>耶和華發盡祂的怒氣，倒出祂的烈怒。祂在錫安使火著起，燒毀錫安的根基。<br>Jehovah has accomplished His  wrath; He has poured out His burning anger. And He has kindled a fire in Zion, And it has consumed its  foundations.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>4:12</a></td><td class=td>地上的君王和世上的居民，都不信敵人和仇敵能進耶路撒冷的城門。<br>The kings of the earth did not believe, Neither did any of the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy would enter Into the gates of Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>4:13</a></td><td class=td>這都因她申言者的罪，和祭司的罪孽；他們在城中流了義人的血。<br>It is because of the sins of her  prophets, And the iniquities of her priests, Who have shed the blood of the righteous In her midst.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>4:14</a></td><td class=td>他們在街上瞎闖亂走，又被血玷汙，以致人不能摸他們的衣服。<br>They have wandered about blind in the streets; They are polluted with blood; So that men cannot touch Their garments.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>4:15</a></td><td class=td>人向他們喊著說，走開！不潔淨的！走開，走開，不要碰我！他們逃走飄流的時候，列國中有人說，他們不可仍在這裏寄居。<br>They cried out to them, Depart! Unclean! Depart, depart; do not touch! When they fled away and wandered about, men said among the nations, They will no longer sojourn there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>4:16</a></td><td class=td>耶和華的怒氣將他們分散，不再眷顧他們；人不重看祭司，也不厚待長老。<br>The anger of Jehovah has scattered them; He will no longer regard them. They did not \caps0 2honor the priests, Nor did they favor the elders.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>4:17</a></td><td class=td>我們仍在仰望幫助，以致眼目昏花，還是枉然；我們所盼望的，竟是一個不能救人的國。<br>Our eyes do yet fail, Looking in vain for our help; In our watching we watched For a nation that could not save.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>4:18</a></td><td class=td>他們像打獵的追蹤我們的腳步，以致我們不能在自己的街上行走；我們的結局臨近，我們的日子滿足，因為我們的結局來到了。<br>They hunted our steps, So that we cannot walk in our streets; Our end drew near; our days were fulfilled; For our end had come.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>4:19</a></td><td class=td>追趕我們的比空中的鷹更快；他們在山上追逼我們，在曠野埋伏等候我們。<br>Our pursuers were swifter Than the eagles of heaven; They hotly pursued us on the mountains; They lay in wait for us in the wilderness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>4:20</a></td><td class=td>耶和華的受膏者好比我們鼻中的氣，在他們的坑中被捉住；我們曾論到他說，我們必在他蔭下，在列國中存活。<br>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, Has been captured in their pits, Of whom we said, Under his shadow We will live among the nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>4:21</a></td><td class=td>住在烏斯地的以東女子阿，隻管歡喜快樂；這杯也必傳到你那裏；你必喝醉，以致露體。<br>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, Who dwells in the land of Uz. Yet the cup will pass through to you also; You will become drunk and make yourself naked.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>4:22</a></td><td class=td>錫安的女子阿，你為罪孽所受的懲罰已經足彀了；耶和華必不使你再被遷徙。以東的女子阿，祂必追討你的罪孽，揭露你的罪。<br>The punishment for your iniquity  has been accomplished,  O daughter of Zion; He will no longer take you into exile. But He will punish your iniquity,  O daughter of Edom; He will uncover your sins.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
