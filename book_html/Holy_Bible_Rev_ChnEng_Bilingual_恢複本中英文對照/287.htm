<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>20:1</a></td><td class=td>在那裏恰有一個卑劣之徒，名叫示巴，是便雅憫人比基利的兒子。他吹角，說，我們在大衛身上無分，在耶西的兒子身上無業。以色列人哪，你們各人回自己的帳棚去罷！<br>Now there was a worthless fellow there whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite. And he blew the trumpet and said, We have no portion in David, Nor do we have an inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, O Israel!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>20:2</a></td><td class=td>於是以色列人都離開大衛上去，不跟隨他，卻跟隨比基利的兒子示巴；但猶大人從約但河直到耶路撒冷，都緊緊跟隨他們的王。<br>And all the men of Israel went up from following David  and followed Sheba the son of Bichri, but the men of Judah clung to their king, from the Jordan to Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>20:3</a></td><td class=td>大衛王來到耶路撒冷自己的宮中，就把從前留下看守宮殿的十個妃嬪放在禁宮裏，供養她們，但不與她們親近。她們被拘禁，過著如同寡婦的生活，直到死的日子。<br>And David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them under guard; and he provided for them but did not go in unto them. So they were shut up until the day of their death, living like widows.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>20:4</a></td><td class=td>王對亞瑪撒說，你要在三日之內將猶大人召集到我這裏來，你也要在這裏。<br>Then the king said to Amasa, Call the men of Judah to me in three days, and you be present here.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>20:5</a></td><td class=td>亞瑪撒就去召集猶大人，卻耽延過了王所限的日期。<br>And Amasa went to call Judah, but he delayed beyond the time that David appointed to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>20:6</a></td><td class=td>大衛對亞比篩說，現在比基利的兒子示巴必加害我們，比押沙龍更甚。你要帶著你主的仆人追趕他，免得他得了堅固城，從我們眼前逃脫。<br>Then David said to Abishai, Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom did. You take servants of your lord and pursue after him; otherwise he will find himself some fortified cities and escape out of our sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>20:7</a></td><td class=td>約押的人和基利提人、比利提人、並所有的勇士，都跟著亞比篩，從耶路撒冷出去，追趕比基利的兒子示巴。<br>So the men of Joab went out after him, along with the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty men; and they went forth from Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>20:8</a></td><td class=td>他們在基遍的大石那裏，亞瑪撒迎麵而來。那時約押束著戰衣，戰衣上有佩刀的帶子係在腰間，刀在鞘內；約押前行，刀從鞘內掉出來。<br>When they were at the large stone that is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was in military dress, and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath, fastened on his loins; and when he went forward, it fell out.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>20:9</a></td><td class=td>約押左手拾起刀來，對亞瑪撒說，我兄弟，你平安麼？就用右手抓住亞瑪撒的胡子，要與他親嘴。亞瑪撒沒有防備約押手裏所拿的刀；約押用刀刺入他的肚腹，他的腸子流在地上；沒有再刺他，他就死了。<br>And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with you, my brother? And he took hold of Amasa's beard with his right hand to kiss him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>20:10</a></td><td class=td>約押和他兄弟亞比篩往前追趕比基利的兒子示巴。<br>But Amasa did not notice the sword which was in Joab's hand. And Joab struck him in the stomach with it and poured out his bowels onto the ground, and he did not  strike him a second time; and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>20:11</a></td><td class=td>有約押的一個少年人站在亞瑪撒屍身旁邊，說，誰喜悅約押，誰歸順大衛，就當跟隨約押去。<br>And one of Joab's young men stood by him and said, Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>20:12</a></td><td class=td>亞瑪撒在路當中，輥在自己的血裏；那少年人看見眾民都站住。他見所有來到亞瑪撒屍身旁的人都站住，就把屍身從大路挪到田間，把一件衣服扔在其上。<br>And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road, and the man saw that all the people stood still. And when he saw that all who came by him were stopping, he carried Amasa off the road into the field and put a garment over him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>20:13</a></td><td class=td>屍身從大路挪移之後，眾民就都過去，跟隨約押去追趕比基利的兒子示巴。<br>As soon as he was removed from the road, all the men went on after Joab to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>20:14</a></td><td class=td>示巴走遍以色列各支派，直到伯瑪迦和亞比拉，並所有比利人之地；那些地方的人也都聚集跟隨他。<br>And Sheba went on throughout all the tribes of Israel to Abel and to Beth- maacah and unto all the Berites; and they gathered together and also went after him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>20:15</a></td><td class=td>約押和跟隨的人到了亞比拉和伯瑪迦，圍困示巴，就對著城築壘，與城外的外牆相對而立；跟隨約押的眾民撞擊城牆，要使牆塌陷。<br>And they came and besieged him at Abel of Beth-maacah; and they cast up a siege mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart. And all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>20:16</a></td><td class=td>有一個聰明的婦人從城上呼叫說，聽阿，聽阿，請對約押說，你走近這裏來，我好與你說話。<br>And a wise woman from the city cried out, Listen! Listen! Say to Joab, Come near here that I may speak to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>20:17</a></td><td class=td>約押就走近婦人那裏，婦人說，你是約押不是？他說，我是。婦人說，請你聽婢女的話。約押說，我在聽。<br>And he came near to her; and the woman said, Are you Joab? And Joab said, I am. And she said to him, Listen to the words of your female servant. And he said, I am listening.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>20:18</a></td><td class=td>婦人說，古時有話說，當先在亞比拉求問，然後事就定妥。<br>Then she spoke, saying, They used to speak in former times, saying, They shall surely ask  for counsel in Abel; and thus they would end  matters.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>20:19</a></td><td class=td>我們這城的人在以色列人中是和平、忠信的；你竟想要毀壞以色列中的大城。你為何要吞滅耶和華的產業呢？<br>I am of the peaceable  and faithful of Israel; you are seeking to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>20:20</a></td><td class=td>約押回答說，絕不是，我絕不吞滅毀壞。<br>And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I would swallow up or destroy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>20:21</a></td><td class=td>事情不是這樣，是因以法蓮山地的一個人，比基利的兒子名叫示巴，舉手攻擊大衛王。你們隻要將他一個人交出來，我便離城而去。婦人對約押說，那人的首級必從城牆上丟給你。<br>The matter is not so, but a man from the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, His head will immediately be thrown over the wall to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>20:22</a></td><td class=td>於是婦人憑她的智慧去勸眾人；他們便割下比基利的兒子示巴的首級，丟給約押。約押吹角，眾人就離城而散，各人回自己的帳棚去了。約押回耶路撒冷，到王那裏。<br>So the woman went to all the people in her wisdom; and they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw  it to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>20:23</a></td><td class=td>約押統領以色列全軍，耶何耶大的兒子比拿雅統管基利提人和比利提人，<br>Now Joab was over all the army of Israel, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>20:24</a></td><td class=td>亞多蘭掌管服苦役的人，亞希律的兒子約沙法作記事官，<br>And Adoram was over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder,</td></tr>
