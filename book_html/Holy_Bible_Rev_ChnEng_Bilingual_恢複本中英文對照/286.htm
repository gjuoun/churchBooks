<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>19:2</a></td><td class=td>那日百姓聽說王為他兒子憂傷，他們眾人得勝的歡樂就變成悲哀。<br>And the victory that day was turned to mourning for all the people, for the people heard it said that day that the king was grieved concerning his son.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>19:3</a></td><td class=td>那日百姓偷偷的進城，就如敗陣逃跑、慚愧的民偷偷逃走一般。<br>And the people stole into the city that day as shamed people steal away when they flee in battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>19:4</a></td><td class=td>王蒙著臉，大聲哀號說，我兒押沙龍阿！押沙龍，我兒，我兒阿！<br>And the king covered his face and cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>19:5</a></td><td class=td>約押進屋子去見王，說，你今日使你一切仆人臉麵慚愧了；他們今日救了你的性命，和你兒女妻妾的性命，<br>Then Joab came to the king at his house and said, Today you have shamed the faces of all your servants, who saved your life today and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and the lives of your concubines,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>19:6</a></td><td class=td>你卻愛那些恨你的人，恨那些愛你的人；你今日表明了，將帥和仆人對你不算什麼。我今日才曉得，若押沙龍活著，我們都死亡，你就喜悅了。<br>In that you love those who hate you and hate those who love you; for you have made it clear today that princes and servants are nothing to you. But I realize today that if Absalom had lived and we all had died today, then it would have been fine in your sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>19:7</a></td><td class=td>現在你當起來，出去安慰你仆人的心。我指著耶和華起誓，你若不出去，今夜必無一人與你同在一處；這禍患就比你從幼年到如今所遭的更甚。<br>Now therefore rise up; go forth and comfort the hearts of your servants. For I swear by Jehovah that if you do not go forth, not a man will remain with you tonight; and that will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>19:8</a></td><td class=td>於是王起來，坐在城門口。有人告訴眾民說，看哪，王坐在城門口；眾民就都到王麵前。以色列人已經逃跑，各人回自己的帳棚去了。<br>So the king rose up and sat in the gate. And all the people were told, saying, The king is now sitting in the gate. And all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled, every man to his tent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>19:9</a></td><td class=td>在以色列眾支派中，眾人紛紛議論說，王曾救我們脫離仇敵的手，又救我們脫離非利士人的手，現在他竟因押沙龍逃離此地。<br>And all the people quarreled throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land because of Absalom.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>19:10</a></td><td class=td>我們所膏為王，治理我們的押沙龍，已經陣亡。現在為什麼不出一言請王回來呢？<br>But Absalom, whom we anointed  as king over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>19:11</a></td><td class=td>大衛王差人去見祭司撒督和亞比亞他，說，你們當向猶大長老說，全以色列的人已經傳話到王那裏，你們在這事上為什麼落後呢？<br>And King David sent  word to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house, seeing that the word of all Israel has come to the king at his house?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>19:12</a></td><td class=td>你們是我的弟兄，是我的骨肉，為什麼要在請王回來的事上落後呢？<br>You are my brothers; you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring the king back?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>19:13</a></td><td class=td>也要對亞瑪撒說，你不是我的骨肉麼？你若不替約押在我麵前常作軍隊的元帥，願神重重的降罰與我。<br>And you shall say to Amasa, Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to me, and even more, if you do not become captain of the army before me continually in the place of Joab.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>19:14</a></td><td class=td>如此，他就使猶大眾人的心轉變，如同一人的心。他們便打發人去見王，說，請王和王的眾臣仆回來。<br>And he turned the heart of all the men of Judah as one man , and they sent  word to the king,  saying, Return, you and all your servants.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>19:15</a></td><td class=td>王就回來，到了約但河；猶大人來到吉甲，要去迎接王，請王過約但河。<br>So the king returned and came to the Jordan, and Judah came to Gilgal to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>19:16</a></td><td class=td>來自巴戶琳的便雅憫人，基拉的兒子示每，急忙與猶大人一同下去迎接大衛王。<br>And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite who was from Bahurim, hurried and went down with the men of Judah to meet King David.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>19:17</a></td><td class=td>跟從示每的有一千便雅憫人，還有掃羅家的仆人洗巴，和他十五個兒子、二十個仆人；他們都速速的過約但河到王麵前。<br>And there were a thousand men with him from Benjamin; and Ziba, the attendant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him  were there. And they rushed down to the Jordan before the king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>19:18</a></td><td class=td>有渡船過去，渡王的家眷，照王所看為好的而行。王要過約但河的時候，基拉的兒子示每俯伏在王麵前，<br>And the crossing was being made in order to bring the king's household over and to do whatever was good in his sight. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was about to cross the Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>19:19</a></td><td class=td>對王說，求我主不要算我為有罪；我主我王出耶路撒冷的那日，你仆人所行悖逆的事，求我主不要記念，也不要放在心上。<br>And he said to the king, Let not my lord consider me guilty; and do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king went forth from Jerusalem, that the king should take it to heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>19:20</a></td><td class=td>你仆人明知自己有罪，所以我今日來了；在約瑟全家之中，我是首先下來迎接我主我王的。<br>For your servant knows that I have sinned; and now I have come today, the first of all the house of Joseph to come down, to meet my lord the king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>19:21</a></td><td class=td>洗魯雅的兒子亞比篩回應說，示每既咒罵耶和華的受膏者，不應當為此處死他麼？<br>Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, for he has cursed Jehovah's anointed?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>19:22</a></td><td class=td>大衛說，洗魯雅的兒子，我與你們何幹，使你們今日作我的對頭呢？今日在以色列中豈可處死人呢？我豈不知今日我作以色列的王麼？<br>And David said, What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah, that you should be an adversary to me today? Should any man in Israel be put to death today? For do I not know that today I am king over Israel?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>19:23</a></td><td class=td>於是王對示每說，你必不死。王又向他起誓。<br>And the king said to Shimei, You will not die. And the king swore  so to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>19:24</a></td><td class=td>掃羅的孫子米非波設也下去迎接王。他自從王離去的那天，直到王平平安安回來的日子，沒有修腳，沒有剃胡須，也沒有洗衣服。<br>Then Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king. Now he had neither taken care of his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he came back in peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>19:25</a></td><td class=td>他從耶路撒冷來迎接王的時候，王問他說，米非波設，你為什麼沒有與我同去呢？<br>And when he came  from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>19:26</a></td><td class=td>他說，我主我王阿，仆人是瘸腿的。那日我心裏說，我要給自己備驢騎上，與王同去，無奈我的仆人欺哄了我，<br>And he said, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for your servant said, I will saddle myself a donkey that I may ride on it and go with the king. For your servant is lame.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>19:27</a></td><td class=td>又在我主我王麵前讒毀我。然而我主我王如同神的使者一般；你看怎樣好，就怎樣行罷。<br>And Ziba slandered your servant before my lord the king. But my lord the king is like an angel of God; therefore do what is good in your sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>19:28</a></td><td class=td>因為我祖全家的人，對於我主我王，不過是該死的人，你卻將仆人列於在王席上吃飯的人中，我現在還有什麼道理再向王哀求呢？<br>For all my father's house were but men worthy of death before my lord the king, but you set your servant among those who eat at your table. What further right then do I have to cry out more to the king?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>19:29</a></td><td class=td>王對他說，你何必再題你的事呢？我說，你要與洗巴均分地土。<br>And the king said to him, Why speak any more of your affairs? I say that you and Ziba shall divide the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>19:30</a></td><td class=td>米非波設對王說，我主我王既平平安安的回宮，就任憑洗巴都取了也可以。<br>And Mephibosheth said to the king, Let him even take it all, since my lord the king has arrived at his house in peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>19:31</a></td><td class=td>基列人巴西萊從羅基琳下來，要送王過約但河，就與王一同過了約但河。<br>Then Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and he crossed over the Jordan with the king, to escort him through the Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>19:32</a></td><td class=td>巴西萊非常老邁，已經八十歲了。王住在瑪哈念的時候，他曾供養王；他原是大富戶。<br>And Barzillai was very old, eighty years of age; and he had provided the king with food while he remained in Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>19:33</a></td><td class=td>王對巴西萊說，你與我一同過去，我要在耶路撒冷供養你，使你在我身邊。<br>And the king said to Barzillai, Cross over with me, and I will provide you with food in Jerusalem at my side.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>19:34</a></td><td class=td>巴西萊對王說，我在世的年日還能有多少，使我與王同上耶路撒冷呢？<br>But Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>19:35</a></td><td class=td>我現在八十歲了，還能嚐出飲食的滋味、辨別美惡麼？還能聽男女歌唱的聲音麼？仆人何必還累贅我主我王呢？<br>I am eighty years old today. Can I discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat and what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men and women? Why then should your servant be a further burden to my lord the king?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>19:36</a></td><td class=td>仆人隻不過略走一點路，陪王過約但河，王何必賜我這樣的賞報呢？<br>Your servant would just cross a little way over the Jordan with the king. Why then should the king reward me with such a reward?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>19:37</a></td><td class=td>求你準仆人回去，好死在我本城，葬在我父母的墓旁。這裏有你的仆人金罕，讓他同我主我王過去；你看怎樣好，就怎樣待他。<br>Let your servant return that I may die in my city near the grave of my father and my mother. But here is your servant Chimham, let him cross over with my lord the king; and do with him what is good in your sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>19:38</a></td><td class=td>王說，金罕可以與我一同過去；你看怎樣好，我就怎樣待他；凡你要我作的，我都必為你成就。<br>And the king said, Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do with him what is good in your sight; and whatever you wish for me to do, I will do for you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>19:39</a></td><td class=td>於是眾民過約但河，王也過去。王與巴西萊親嘴，為他祝福，巴西萊就回本地去了。<br>And all the people crossed over the Jordan, and the king crossed over. And the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own place.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=40>19:40</a></td><td class=td>王過去，到了吉甲，金罕也跟他過去。猶大眾民和以色列民的一半也都送王過去。<br>So the king crossed over to Gilgal, and Chimham crossed over with him. And all the people of Judah, and half the people of Israel as well, brought the king over.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=41>19:41</a></td><td class=td>以色列眾人來見王，對王說，我們弟兄猶大人為什麼偷偷的送王和王的家眷，以及所有屬大衛的人過約但河？<br>Then all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king, Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away and brought the king and his household over the Jordan along with the men of David with him?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=42>19:42</a></td><td class=td>猶大眾人回答以色列人說，因為王與我們是親屬，你們為何因這事發怒？我們吃了王的什麼呢？王賜了我們什麼禮物呢？<br>And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king's expense? Or has he given us any gift?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=43>19:43</a></td><td class=td>以色列人回答猶大人說，按支派，我們在王身上有十分；在大衛身上，我們也比你們更有分。你們為何藐視我們？請王回來不是我們先說的麼？但猶大人的話比以色列人的話更硬。<br>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, We have ten parts in the king, and in David too we have more than you. Why then have you despised us? And were we not the first to speak of bringing our king back? But the speaking of the men of Judah was more prevailing than the speaking of the men of Israel.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
