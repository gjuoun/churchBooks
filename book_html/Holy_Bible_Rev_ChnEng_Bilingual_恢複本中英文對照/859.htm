<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>9:5</a></td><td class=td>我們犯罪作孽，行惡悖逆，偏離你的誡命典章。<br>We have sinned and have committed iniquity, and we have acted wickedly and rebelled, to the point of even turning away from Your commandments and from Your judgments.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>9:6</a></td><td class=td>沒有聽從你仆人眾申言者，在你名裏向我們君王、首領、列祖、和那地一切百姓所說的話。<br>And we have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our chief men, and our fathers, as well as to all the people of the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>9:7</a></td><td class=td>主阿，公義歸於你，滿麵羞愧歸於我們，正如今日一樣，就是歸於猶大人和耶路撒冷的居民、並以色列眾人，或在近處，或在遠處，被你趕到各地的人，因為他們犯了對你不忠信的罪。<br>To You, Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us, shamefacedness, as it is this day, that is, to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to all Israel, those who are near and those who are far off in all the lands to which You have driven them because of their trespass by which they have trespassed against You.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>9:11</a></td><td class=td>以色列眾人都犯了你的律法，甚至偏離，不聽從你的話；因此，在你仆人摩西律法上所寫的咒詛和誓言，都傾倒在我們身上，因為我們得罪了神。<br>Indeed, all Israel has transgressed Your law, to the point of even turning away so as not to obey Your voice; thus the curse has been poured out upon us, the very oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we have sinned against Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>9:12</a></td><td class=td>祂使大災禍臨到我們，證實了祂警戒我們的話，和祂警戒那些審判我們之審判官的話；原來在普天之下，未曾行過像在耶路撒冷所行的。<br>And He has confirmed His words which He spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us great ill; for under all heaven there has not been done anything like that which has been done in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
