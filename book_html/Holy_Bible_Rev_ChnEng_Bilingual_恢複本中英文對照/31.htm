<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>31:35</a></td><td class=td>拉結對她父親說，現在我身上不便，不能在你麵前起來，求我主不要動怒。這樣，拉班搜尋神像，竟沒有搜出來。<br>And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before you, for the manner of women is upon me. So he searched but did not find the household idols.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>31:36</a></td><td class=td>雅各就發怒，與拉班爭論，說，我有什麼過犯，有什麼罪，你竟這樣火速的追我？<br>And Jacob became angry and contended with Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my transgression? What is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued me?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>31:37</a></td><td class=td>你摸遍了我一切的物件，搜出什麼是你家的東西呢？可以放在你我的弟兄們麵前，叫他們在我們二人中間判斷判斷。<br>Although you have rummaged through all my possessions, what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my brothers and your brothers, that they may decide between the two of us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>31:38</a></td><td class=td>我同你在一起這二十年，你的母綿羊、母山羊沒有掉過胎；你群中的公羊，我沒有吃過；<br>These twenty years have I been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>31:39</a></td><td class=td>被野獸撕裂的，我沒有帶來給你，是我自己賠上。無論是白日，是黑夜，被偷去的，你都向我索要。<br>That which was torn by beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=40>31:40</a></td><td class=td>我白日受幹熱銷磨，黑夜受寒霜侵蝕，不得合眼睡著，我常是這樣。<br>Thus I was: By day the dry heat consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=41>31:41</a></td><td class=td>我這二十年在你家裏，為你的兩個女兒服事你十四年，為你的羊群服事你六年，你十次改了我的工價。<br>These twenty years have I been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.</td></tr>

God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=43>31:43</a></td><td class=td>拉班回答雅各說，女兒是我的女兒，孩子是我的孩子，羊群也是我的羊群；凡在你眼前的都是我的。我的女兒並她們所生的孩子，我今日能向他們作什麼呢？<br>And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=44>31:44</a></td><td class=td>來罷，你我二人可以立約，作你我中間的證據。<br>So come now; let us make a covenant, I and you; and let it be a witness between me and you.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=47>31:47</a></td><td class=td>拉班稱那石堆為伊迦爾撒哈杜他，雅各卻稱那石堆為迦累得。<br>And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=48>31:48</a></td><td class=td>拉班說，今日這石堆作你我中間的證據。因此那地方名叫迦累得，<br>And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and you today. Therefore its name was called Galeed</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=49>31:49</a></td><td class=td>又叫米斯巴，因為他說，我們彼此離別以後，願耶和華在你我中間鑒察。<br>And Mizpah, because he said, Jehovah watch between me and you when we are absent from one another.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=50>31:50</a></td><td class=td>你若苦待我的女兒，又在我的女兒以外另娶妻子，雖然沒有人同我們在一起，卻有神在你我中間作見證。<br>If you afflict my daughters, and if you take wives besides my daughters-even though no man is with us-see, God is witness between me and you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=51>31:51</a></td><td class=td>拉班又對雅各說，你看這石堆，和我在你我中間所立的柱子。<br>And Laban said to Jacob, Here is this heap, and here is the pillar which I have set between me and you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=52>31:52</a></td><td class=td>這石堆作證據，這柱子也作證據；我必不過這石堆去害你，你也不可過這石堆和柱子來害我。<br>This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass beyond this heap to you and that you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=53>31:53</a></td><td class=td>但願亞伯拉罕的神和拿鶴的神，就是他們父親的神，在你我中間判斷。雅各就指著他父親以撒所敬畏的神起誓，<br>The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the Dread of his father Isaac.</td></tr>
