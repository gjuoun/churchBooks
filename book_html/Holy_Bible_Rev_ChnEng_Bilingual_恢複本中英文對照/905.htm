<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>我要站在我的守望所，立在堡壘上觀望，看耶和華要對我說什麼，我要怎樣為我的訴冤有所回應。<br>I will stand at my watch And station myself on the  fortress, And I will watch to see what He will speak to me And what I will reply concerning my complaint.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>耶和華回答說，將這異象明明的寫在版上，使讀的人容易讀。<br>Then Jehovah answered and said, Write the vision, and render it  plainly upon tablets,  That even he who runs by may read it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>因為這異象有一定的時期，快要達到終局，並非虛謊；雖然遲延，還要等候；因為必然臨到，不再耽延。<br>For the vision is yet for the appointed time, And it hastens toward the end and will not lie. Though it tarries, wait for it; For it will surely come; it will not delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>看哪，自高自大的人，心不正直；隻是義人必本於信得生。<br>See, he who is puffed up, his soul is not upright within him, But the righteous one will live by his faith.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>然而，那因酒詭詐，狂傲之人，不住在家中，擴充欲望好像陰間，又像死亡不能知足，卻聚集萬國，堆積萬民，都歸自己。<br>Furthermore his wine is  treacherous: A boasting man, he does not abide at home, He who enlarges his  appetite like Sheol, And is like death and cannot be satisfied, But gathers to himself all the nations And collects for himself all the peoples.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>這些國的民豈不都要題起比喻，就是譏誚歌和謎語，指著他說，禍哉，那增添不屬自己之財物，滿載別人抵押品的；他這樣作，要到幾時呢？<br>Will not all of these take up a parable against him, Indeed a mocking song and a riddle against him, and say, Woe to him who increases what is not his (For how long?) And who loads himself with the burden of pledges?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>咬傷你的豈不忽然起來，攪擾你的豈不醒起，你就成了他們的擄物麼？<br>Will not those who bite you rise up suddenly, And those who shake you awake, And you will become booty to them?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>因你搶奪許多的國，殺人流血，向地上城邑，並其中一切居民施行強暴，所以各族餘剩的人都必搶奪你。<br>Because you have plundered many nations; All the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, Because of the bloodshed of men and the violence done to the land, To the city, and to all the inhabitants in it.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>你剪除多族的人，正是圖謀使自己的家蒙羞，犯罪自害己命。<br>You have devised shame against your own house By cutting off many peoples, And have sinned against your own soul.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>牆裏的石頭必呼叫，木料中的椽子必應聲。<br>For the stone will cry out from the wall, And the rafter will answer from the timber.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>藉流人血建城，以罪孽立邑的有禍了！<br>Woe to him who builds a city by bloodshed And establishes a town by iniquity!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>眾民所勞碌得來的被火焚燒，列國由勞乏而得的歸於虛空，不都是出於萬軍之耶和華麼？<br>Indeed is it not of Jehovah of  hosts That the peoples toil for the  fire And the nations weary themselves for vanity?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>對耶和華之榮耀的認識，要充滿遍地，好像水充滿洋海一般。<br>For the earth will be filled With the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah As water covers the sea.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>給鄰舍酒喝，又加上他的毒物，使鄰舍喝醉，好看見他赤身的，有禍了！<br>Woe to him who makes his neighbor drink, Adding in  his poison, And also making him drunk In order to look at their nakedness!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>你滿受羞辱，不得榮耀。你也喝罷，顯出是未受割禮的！耶和華右手的杯必傳到你那裏，你的榮耀就變為極大的羞辱。<br>You are sated with shame, not glory. You also, drink and be shown to be uncircumcised! The cup of Jehovah's right hand will come around to you, And disgrace will be upon your glory.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>你向利巴嫩所行的強暴，與殘害驚嚇野獸的事，必遮蓋你，因你殺人流血，向地上城邑，並其中一切居民施行強暴。<br>For the violence done to Lebanon will cover you, As well as the destruction of the beasts which frightened them, Because of the bloodshed of men and the violence done to the land, To the city, and to all the inhabitants in it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>雕製的偶像，人將他雕製出來，有什麼益處呢？鑄造的偶像，就是虛謊的師傅，製造者倚靠所造的，他製造啞吧偶像，有什麼益處呢？<br>What profit is the graven idol that its maker should engrave it, Or the molten idol, even the teacher of lies, That he who forms its form depends on it To make dumb idols?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>對木頭說，醒起，對啞吧石頭說，起來，那人有禍了！這東西能教訓人麼？看哪，是包裹金銀的，其中毫無氣息。<br>Woe to him who says to wood, Awake! And, Arise! to silent stone. Will it teach him? Behold, it is set in gold and silver, And there is no  breath at all within it.</td></tr>
