<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>6:3</a></td><td class=td>於是我差遣人去見他們，說，我現在辦理大工，不能下去。我為何放開工作，下去見你們，使工作停頓呢？<br>And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work and cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it to come down to you?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>6:4</a></td><td class=td>他們四次這樣打發人來見我，我都如此回答。<br>And they sent word to me four times in this way, and I answered them in this way.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>6:5</a></td><td class=td>參巴拉第五次這樣打發仆人來見我，手裏拿著未封的信，<br>Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in this way the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>6:6</a></td><td class=td>信上寫著說，外邦人中有風聲，基善也說，你和猶大人謀反，因此你建造城牆。照他們這些話，你要作他們的王。<br>In which was written: It is reported among the nations, and Geshem says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel; therefore you are building the wall. And, according to these words, you are to be their king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>6:7</a></td><td class=td>你又設立申言者在耶路撒冷指著你宣告說，在猶大有王了！現在這些話必傳與王知；所以請你來，與我們彼此商議。<br>And you have also set up prophets to declare in Jerusalem concerning you, saying, There is a king in Judah! And now a report will be made to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>6:8</a></td><td class=td>我就差遣人去見他，說，你所說的這些事，一概沒有，是你自己心裏捏造的。<br>Then I sent word to him, saying, None of these things that you are saying have happened; rather you have invented them in your own heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>6:9</a></td><td class=td>他們都要使我們懼怕，意思說，他們的手必軟弱不能作工，以致工作不能成就。現在，神阿，求你堅固我的手。<br>For all of them tried to frighten us, thinking, Their hands will be weakened from working, and it will not be done. But now strengthen my hands!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>6:10</a></td><td class=td>我到了米希大別的孫子，第來雅的兒子示瑪雅家；那時，他閉門不出。他說，我們不如在神的殿，在殿堂中會麵，將殿堂的門關鎖；因為他們要來殺你，就是在夜裏來殺你。<br>And I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who had shut himself up.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>6:12</a></td><td class=td>我看出神並沒有差遣他，是他自己這樣申言攻擊我，是多比雅和參巴拉賄買了他。<br>Then I perceived that surely God had not sent him but that he spoke this prophecy against me and that Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>6:13</a></td><td class=td>賄買他的緣故，是要叫我懼怕，依從他這樣行，以致犯罪，他們就有理由傳揚惡言毀謗我。<br>He had been hired for this reason, that I would be frightened and that I would act in such a way as to sin; then they would have cause for an evil report in order to reproach me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>6:14</a></td><td class=td>我的神阿，求你記得多比雅和參巴拉，照著他們所作的這些事報應他們，也要記得女申言者挪亞底和其餘的申言者，他們想要叫我懼怕。<br>Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these works of theirs, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets, who tried to frighten me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>6:15</a></td><td class=td>以祿月二十五日，城牆修完了，共修了五十二天。<br>So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Elul, in fifty-two days.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>6:17</a></td><td class=td>再者，在那些日子，猶大的貴胄屢次寄信與多比雅，多比雅也來信與他們。<br>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came to them;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>6:18</a></td><td class=td>在猶大有許多人與多比雅結盟，因他是亞拉兒子示迦尼的女婿，並且他的兒子約哈難娶了比利迦兒子米書蘭的女兒為妻。<br>For many in Judah were sworn to his cause because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as his wife.</td></tr>
