<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>7:4</a></td><td class=td>妻子對自己的身體沒有主權，丈夫才有；照樣，丈夫對自己的身體也沒有主權，妻子才有。<br>The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise the husband also does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>7:5</a></td><td class=td>你們不可彼此虧負，除非出於同意，暫時分房，為要專心禱告，以後仍要同房，免得撒但因你們不能自製，試誘你們。<br>Do not deprive each other, except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then be together again, that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>7:6</a></td><td class=td>我說這話，是容許你們，並不是命令。<br>But this I say by way of concession, not by way of command. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>7:7</a></td><td class=td>我願意眾人都像我一樣；隻是各人都有自己從神得來的恩賜，有人是這樣，有人是那樣。<br>Yet I wish all men to be even as I am myself; but each has his own gift from God, one in this way, the other in that. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>7:8</a></td><td class=td>我對未婚的和寡婦說，若他們常像我就好。<br>But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I am. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>7:14</a></td><td class=td>因為不信的丈夫，就因著妻子被聖別，並且不信的妻子，也因著弟兄被聖別；不然，你們的兒女就不潔淨，但如今他們是聖別的了。<br>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother; otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>7:15</a></td><td class=td>倘若那不信的人離去，就由他離去吧；無論是弟兄、是姊妹，在這種情形之下，都不必受束縛，然而神已經在平安裏召了我們。<br>But if the unbelieving one separates, let him separate; the brother or the sister is not enslaved in such cases, but God has called us in peace. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>7:16</a></td><td class=td>況且你這作妻子的，怎麼知道能不能救你的丈夫？你這作丈夫的，怎麼知道能不能救你的妻子？<br>For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>7:17</a></td><td class=td>隻要照主所分給各人的，和神所召各人的而行。我在眾召會中都是這樣吩咐。<br>However as the Lord has apportioned to each one, as God has called each one, so let him walk. And so I direct in all the churches. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>7:18</a></td><td class=td>有人蒙召時已受割禮，就不要回複原狀；有人蒙召時未受割禮，就不要受割禮。<br>Was anyone called having been circumcised? He need not efface it. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? He need not be circumcised. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>7:19</a></td><td class=td>受割禮算不得什麼，不受割禮也算不得什麼，隻有遵守神的誡命才算得數。<br>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of God's commandments is what counts. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>7:20</a></td><td class=td>各人在什麼身分裏蒙召，仍要留於這身分。<br>Each one, in the calling in which he was called, in this let him remain. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>7:22</a></td><td class=td>因為一個奴仆在主裏蒙召，就是屬於主得自由的人；照樣，一個自由的人蒙召，就是基督的奴仆。<br>For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lord's freedman; likewise the free man who has been called is Christ's slave. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>7:23</a></td><td class=td>你們是重價買來的，不要作人的奴仆。<br>You were bought with a price; do not be slaves of men. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>7:25</a></td><td class=td>關於童身的人，我沒有主的命令，但我既蒙主憐憫成為忠信的，就提出我的意見。<br>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>7:26</a></td><td class=td>因現今的艱難，我以為人最好保持現狀。<br>I consider then that this is good because of the present necessity, that it is good for a man to be as he is. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>7:27</a></td><td class=td>你有妻子束縛著麼？就不要尋求脫離。你沒有妻子束縛著麼？就不要尋求妻子。<br>Have you been bound to a wife? Do not seek a release. Have you been released from a wife? Do not seek a wife. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>7:28</a></td><td class=td>但你若娶妻，也不是犯罪；處女若出嫁，也不是犯罪；然而這等人肉身必受苦難，我卻願意你們免受這苦難。<br>But even if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if the virgin marries, she has not sinned; but such ones will have affliction in the flesh, and I am trying to spare you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>7:29</a></td><td class=td>隻是弟兄們，我對你們說，時候縮短了。從此以後，那有妻子的，要像沒有妻子；<br>But this I say, brothers, the time is shortened. Henceforth both those who have wives should be as though they had none, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>7:30</a></td><td class=td>哀哭的，要像不哀哭；喜樂的，要像不喜樂；置買的，要像無所擁有；<br>And those who weep as though they did not weep, and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, and those who buy as though they did not possess, </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>7:32</a></td><td class=td>我願你們無所掛慮。沒有娶妻的，是為主的事掛慮，想怎樣討主喜悅；<br>But I desire you to be without care. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>7:33</a></td><td class=td>娶了妻的，是為世上的事掛慮，想怎樣討妻子喜悅，就分心了。<br>But he who has married cares for the things of the world, how he may please his wife, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>7:34</a></td><td class=td>未結婚的婦女和守童身的女子，是為著主的事掛慮，要在身體和靈上都聖別；已經出嫁的，是為世上的事掛慮，想怎樣討丈夫喜悅。<br>And is distracted. Both the unmarried woman and the virgin care for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit; but she who has married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>7:35</a></td><td class=td>我說這話，是為你們自己的益處；不是要牢籠你們，乃是要叫你們行合宜的事，得以殷勤服事主，沒有分心的事。<br>But this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a noose upon you but that you may be comely and may wait on the Lord without distraction. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>7:36</a></td><td class=td>若有人以為待他的童身女兒不合宜，她也過了華齡，事又當行，他就可隨願辦理，不是犯罪，讓他們結婚。<br>But if anyone thinks that he is behaving unbecomingly to his virgin daughter, if she is past the bloom of youth and thus it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let them marry. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>7:37</a></td><td class=td>但他若心裏堅定，沒有不得已的事，對自己的意思又有主權，心裏也決定了留下自己的童身女兒，如此行也好。<br>But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, and has authority with respect to his own will and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin daughter, he will do well. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>7:38</a></td><td class=td>這樣看來，叫自己的童身女兒出嫁是好，不叫她出嫁更是好。<br>So then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>7:39</a></td><td class=td>丈夫活著的時候，妻子是被束縛的；丈夫若睡了，妻子就可以自由，隨願嫁人，隻是要嫁在主裏的人。<br>A wife is bound for so long a time as her husband lives; but should the husband fall asleep, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only to one in the Lord. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=40>7:40</a></td><td class=td>然而，按我的意見，她若守節更是有福；但我想我也有神的靈了。<br>But she is more blessed if she so remains, according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
