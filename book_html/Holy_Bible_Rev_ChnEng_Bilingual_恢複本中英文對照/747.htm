<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>那時以色列歸耶和華為聖，作為祂所出產的初熟果子；凡吞吃他的，便算為有罪，災禍就臨到他們；這是耶和華說的。<br>Israel was holiness to Jehovah, The firstfruits of His increase; All who ate of it were guilty; Evil came upon them, Declares Jehovah.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>他們也不說，那領我們從埃及地上來，引導我們經過曠野，經過沙漠有深坑之地，經過幹旱死蔭之地，經過無人通行、無人居住之地的耶和華在那裏呢？<br>And they did not say, Where is Jehovah, Who brought us up from the land of Egypt, Who brought us through the wilderness, Through a land of deserts and pits, Through a land of drought and the shadow of death, Through a land that no one passes through And where no man dwells?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>祭司都不說，耶和華在那裏呢？執掌律法的，都不認識我，牧者違背我，申言者藉巴力說豫言，隨從無益之物。<br>The priests did not say, Where is Jehovah? And those who handle the law did not know Me, And the shepherds transgressed against Me, And the prophets prophesied by Baal And followed after things that did not benefit them.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>因為我的百姓，作了兩件惡事，就是離棄我這活水的泉源，為自己鑿出池子，是破裂不能存水的池子。<br>For My people have committed two evils: They have forsaken Me, The fountain of living waters, To hew out for themselves cisterns, Broken cisterns, Which hold no water.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>這事臨到你身上，不是你自招的麼？不是因耶和華你神引你行路的時候，你離棄了祂麼？<br>Have you not done this to yourself By your forsaking Jehovah your God When He was leading you in the way?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>現今你為何在往埃及的路上，要喝西曷的水呢？你為何在往亞述的路上，要喝大河的水呢？<br>And now what do you have on the road to Egypt, To drink the waters of the Shihor? And what do you have on the road to Assyria, To drink the waters of the River?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>你自己的惡必懲治你，你背道的事必責備你。因此要知道並看見，你離棄耶和華你的神，對我毫無畏懼，乃為惡事，為苦事；這是主萬軍之耶和華說的。<br>Your own wickedness will correct  you, And your apostasies will reprove you. Know therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing, That you have forsaken Jehovah your God And that My fear is not in you, Declares the Lord Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>

Indeed upon every high hill And under every flourishing tree You have lain down, you have committed fornication.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>2:21</a></td><td class=td>然而我栽種你是上好的葡萄樹，全然是真種子。你怎麼向我變為外邦葡萄樹的壞枝條呢？<br>Yet I, I had planted you as a choice vine, Wholly a faithful seed. How then have you turned yourself before Me Into the degenerate shoots of a foreign vine?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>2:22</a></td><td class=td>你雖用堿，多用肥皂洗濯，你罪孽的汙漬仍然留在我麵前；這是主耶和華說的。<br>For though you wash yourself with lye And make use of much soap, Your iniquity remains as a stain before Me, Declares the Lord Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>2:23</a></td><td class=td>你怎能說，我沒有被玷汙，沒有隨從眾巴力？看你穀中的路，就知道你所作的如何。你像快行的小駱駝，狂奔亂走；<br>How can you say, I am not  defiled; I have not gone after the Baals? Look at your way in the valley; Know what you have done. You are like a swift young camel entangling her ways,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>2:24</a></td><td class=td>你像野母驢慣在曠野，欲心發動就吸風喘氣。她起性的時候，誰能使她轉回呢？凡尋找她的，必不至疲乏：在她的月分，必能尋見。<br>Like a wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness, Panting after the wind in her  desire. In her passion who can turn her  away? None that seek her will weary themselves: They will find her in her month.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>2:25</a></td><td class=td>我說，你不要使腳上無鞋，喉嚨幹渴；你倒說，這是枉然。我喜愛外邦神，我必隨從他們。<br>Keep your foot from being unshod And your throat from thirst; But you said, It is hopeless. No! For I have loved strangers, And I will go after them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>2:26</a></td><td class=td>賊被捉拿，怎樣羞愧，以色列家和他們的君王、首領、祭司、申言者，也照樣羞愧。<br>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, So the house of Israel is  ashamed-They, their kings, their princes, And their priests and their  prophets,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>2:27</a></td><td class=td>他們向樹木說，你是我的父；向石頭說，你生了我。他們以背向著我，不以麵向著我；及至遭遇患難的時候卻說，起來拯救我們。<br>Who say to a tree, You are my father; And to a stone, You have brought me forth-For they have turned their back to Me, And not their faces. Yet in a time of their trouble they will say, Arise and save us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>2:28</a></td><td class=td>你為自己作的神在那裏？你遭遇患難的時候，他們若能拯救你，就叫他們起來罷。猶大阿，你神的數目，與你城的數目相等。<br>But where are your gods, whom you made for yourselves? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble; For according to the number of your cities Are your gods, O Judah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>2:29</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，你們為何與我爭辯？你們都違背了我。<br>Why do you contend with Me? You have all transgressed against  Me, Declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>2:30</a></td><td class=td>我責打你們的兒女，是徒然的：他們不受管教；你們自己的刀，吞滅你們的申言者，好像殘害的獅子。<br>In vain I have stricken your children: They have taken no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets Like a destroying lion.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>2:31</a></td><td class=td>這世代的人哪，你們要注意耶和華的話：我豈向以色列成了曠野麼？或成了幽暗之地麼？我的百姓為何說，我們自由無拘，再不來你這裏了？<br>O generation, attend to the word of Jehovah: Have I been a wilderness to Israel, Or a land of deep darkness? Why do My people say, We roam about; We will no longer come to You?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>2:32</a></td><td class=td>處女豈能忘記她的妝飾呢？新婦豈能忘記她的美衣呢？我的百姓，卻忘記了我無數的日子。<br>Can the virgin forget her ornaments, Or the bride her attire? But My people have forgotten Me For days without number.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>2:33</a></td><td class=td>你多麼會修飾自己的道路，去尋求愛情！所以連惡劣的婦人，你也教導她們行你的路。<br>How you prepare your ways To seek love! Therefore ou have even taught Wicked women your ways.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>2:34</a></td><td class=td>並且你的衣襟上有無辜窮人的血；你殺他們，並不是遇見他們挖洞入屋，乃是因這一切的事。<br>Also on your skirts is found The lifeblood of the innocent  poor. You did not find them breaking in, But killed them because of all these things.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>2:35</a></td><td class=td>你還說，我是無辜的；耶和華的怒氣，必定從我轉消了。我必審問你，因你說，我沒有犯罪。<br>But you said, I am innocent; Surely His anger will turn from  me. I am about to enter into judgment with you, Because you say, I have not sinned.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>2:36</a></td><td class=td>你為何東奔西跑，更換你的道路呢？你也必因埃及蒙羞，像從前因亞述蒙羞一樣。<br>Why do you go about so much To change your way? You will be put to shame by Egypt  also, Even as you were put to shame by Assyria.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>2:37</a></td><td class=td>你必兩手抱頭，從埃及出來；因為耶和華已經棄絕你所倚靠的，你必不因他們得亨通。<br>Indeed, from it you will go forth With your hands upon your head; For Jehovah has rejected those in whom you trust, And you will not prosper by them.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
