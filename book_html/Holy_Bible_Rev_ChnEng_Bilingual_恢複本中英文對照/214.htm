<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>3:21</a></td><td class=td>以笏便伸左手，從右邊大腿上拔出劍來，刺入王的肚腹，<br>And Ehud put his left hand into his garment and took the dagger from his right thigh, and he drove it into his belly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>3:22</a></td><td class=td>連劍柄也隨著劍身刺進去了；肥肉把劍身夾住，他沒有把劍從王的肚腹拔出來。他就出到庭院。<br>And the hilt also went in, after the blade; and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the dagger from his belly. And he went out into the courtyard.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>3:23</a></td><td class=td>以笏出到遊廊，將樓門關鎖，把王關在裏麵。<br>Then Ehud went out onto the porch, and he closed the doors of the upper room on  Eglon and locked them.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>3:25</a></td><td class=td>他們等煩了，見王仍不開樓門，就拿鑰匙開了；不料，他們的主人已倒在地上死了。<br>And they waited until they were ashamed, but still he was not opening the doors of the upper room. Then they took the key and opened them. And there was their lord, fallen to the ground dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>3:26</a></td><td class=td>他們耽延的時候，以笏逃跑了，經過雕像那裏，逃到西伊拉。<br>And Ehud escaped while they delayed, and he passed by the sculptured idols and escaped to Seirah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>3:27</a></td><td class=td>到了，就在以法蓮山地吹角；以色列人隨著他下了山地，他在他們前頭領路，<br>And when he arrived, he blew the horn in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came down with him from the hill country, and he was before them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>3:28</a></td><td class=td>對他們說，你們緊緊跟著我，因為耶和華已經把你們的仇敵摩押人交在你們手中。於是他們跟著他下去，把守約但河的渡口，攔截摩押人，不容一人過去。<br>And he said to them, Follow closely after me, for Jehovah has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.
