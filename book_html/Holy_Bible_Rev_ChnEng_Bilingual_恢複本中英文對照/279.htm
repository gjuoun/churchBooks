<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>12:1</a></td><td class=td>耶和華差遣拿單去見大衛。拿單到了大衛那裏，對他說，在一座城裏有兩個人，一個是富戶，一個是窮人。<br>Then Jehovah sent Nathan to David. And he went to him and said to him, Two men lived in a city, one rich and the other poor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>12:2</a></td><td class=td>富戶有許多羊群牛群；<br>The rich man had very many flocks and herds,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>12:3</a></td><td class=td>窮人除了所買來養活的一隻小母羊羔之外，別無所有。羊羔在他和他兒女身邊長大，吃他那一點的食物，喝他杯中所有的，睡在他懷中，對於他如同女兒一樣。<br>But the poor man had nothing but one small ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he nourished it, and it grew up together with him and his children; it ate of the morsels of his food and drank out of his own cup and lay on his bosom; indeed it was like a daughter to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>12:4</a></td><td class=td>有一旅客來到富戶那裏；富戶舍不得從自己的羊群牛群中取一隻豫備給過路的客人吃，卻取了那窮人的羊羔，豫備給到他那裏的人吃。<br>And there came a traveler to the rich man. But the rich man refused to take  something from his own flock and herd to dress for the wayfarer who had come to him; but he took the poor man's ewe lamb and dressed it for the man who had come to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>12:5</a></td><td class=td>大衛就甚惱怒那人，對拿單說，我指著永活的耶和華起誓，行這事的人該死；<br>And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man. And he said to Nathan, As Jehovah lives, the man who has done this is worthy of death;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>12:6</a></td><td class=td>他必償還羊羔四倍，因為他行了這事，又因為他沒有憐恤的心。<br>And he shall restore the ewe lamb fourfold because he has done this thing and because he had no pity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>12:7</a></td><td class=td>拿單對大衛說，你就是那人。耶和華以色列的神如此說，我膏你作以色列的王，救你脫離掃羅的手；<br>Then Nathan said to David, You are the man. Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>12:8</a></td><td class=td>我將你主人的家業賜給你，將你主人的妻妾交在你懷裏，又將以色列和猶大家賜給你；這若是太少，還可以多多的加給你。<br>And I gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your bosom, and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah; and if this were too little, I would have added to you such and such things.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>12:9</a></td><td class=td>你為什麼藐視耶和華的話，行祂眼中看為惡的事？你用刀擊殺赫人烏利亞，又娶了他的妻子作你的妻子；你是借亞捫人的刀殺了他。<br>Why have you despised the word of Jehovah by doing what is evil in His sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife as your wife and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>12:10</a></td><td class=td>你既藐視我，娶了赫人烏利亞的妻子為妻，故此刀劍必永不離開你的家。<br>Now therefore the sword will not depart from your house forever because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>12:11</a></td><td class=td>耶和華如此說，看哪，我必從你家中興起禍患攻擊你；我必在你眼前把你的妻妾賜給與你親近的人，他必在日光之下與她們同寢。<br>Thus says Jehovah, I will now raise up trouble against you from within your house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and will give  them to your companion, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>12:12</a></td><td class=td>你在暗中行這事，我卻要在全以色列麵前，在日光之下施行報應。<br>For you did  this secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and  even before the sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>12:13</a></td><td class=td>大衛對拿單說，我得罪耶和華了。拿單說，耶和華已經除掉你的罪，你必不至於死。<br>And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said to David, Jehovah has also put away your sin; you will not die.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>12:14</a></td><td class=td>隻是你因著行這事，叫耶和華的仇敵大得褻瀆的機會，故此，你所得的兒子必定要死。<br>Nevertheless, because you have given the enemies of Jehovah much occasion to blaspheme  Him because of this thing, the son who is born to you shall also surely die.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>12:15</a></td><td class=td>拿單就回家去了。耶和華擊打烏利亞妻子給大衛所生的孩子，他就得了重病。<br>Then Nathan went to his house. And Jehovah struck the child whom Uriah's wife bore to David, and he was very sick.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>12:16</a></td><td class=td>大衛為這孩子懇求神，而且禁食，進入內室，終夜躺在地上。<br>And David besought God for the child; and David fasted and went in and spent all night lying on the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>12:17</a></td><td class=td>他家中的老仆來到他身邊，要把他從地上扶起來，他卻不願意，也不同他們吃飯。<br>And the elders of his house stood over him to raise him from the ground; but he did not want to, nor would he eat food with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>12:18</a></td><td class=td>到第七日，孩子死了。大衛的臣仆不敢告訴他孩子死了，因他們說，看哪，0孩子還活著的時候，我們對他說話，他尚且不肯聽；我們怎能告訴他孩子死了？他可能會傷害自己。<br>And on the seventh day the child died. And David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, While the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to our voice; how then can we tell him that the child is dead? He will do  himself some harm.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>12:19</a></td><td class=td>大衛見臣仆彼此低聲說話，就知道孩子死了。他對臣仆說，孩子死了麼？他們說，死了。<br>And David saw that his servants were whispering, and David perceived that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said,  He is dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>12:20</a></td><td class=td>大衛就從地上起來，沐浴，抹膏，換了衣裳，進耶和華的殿敬拜；然後回宮，要人擺飯，他便吃了。<br>Then David rose up from the ground and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. And he went to the house of Jehovah and worshipped. Then he went to his house; and when he requested  it, they set food before him, and he ate.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>12:21</a></td><td class=td>臣仆對他說，你所行的這事，是什麼意思？孩子活著的時候，你禁食哭泣；孩子死了，你倒起來吃飯。<br>And his servants said to him, What is this thing that you have done? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept; but as soon as the child died, you rose up and ate bread.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>12:22</a></td><td class=td>大衛說，孩子還活著，我禁食哭泣；因為我想，誰知道呢？或許耶和華施恩與我，使孩子得以存活。<br>And he said, While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I thought, Who knows? Jehovah may be gracious to me, and the child may live.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>12:23</a></td><td class=td>如今孩子死了，我何必禁食？我豈能使他返回？我必往他那裏去，他卻不能回我這裏來。<br>But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not come back to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>12:24</a></td><td class=td>大衛安慰他的妻子拔示巴，進到她那裏去，與她同寢，她就生了一個兒子，大衛給他起名叫所羅門。耶和華喜愛他，<br>And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife and went in unto her and lay with her. And she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>12:25</a></td><td class=td>就差遣申言者拿單，為耶和華的緣故給他起名叫耶底底亞。<br>And He sent  word through Nathan the prophet and called his name Jedidiah for Jehovah's sake.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>12:26</a></td><td class=td>約押攻打亞捫人的拉巴，取了那京城。<br>Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon and took the royal city.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>12:27</a></td><td class=td>約押打發使者去見大衛，說，我攻打拉巴，取了水城。<br>And Joab sent messengers to David and said, I have fought against Rabbah; indeed I have taken the city of water.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>12:28</a></td><td class=td>現在你要聚集其餘的軍兵來，安營圍攻這城，取下這城；免得我取了這城，人就以我的名叫這城。<br>Now therefore gather the rest of the people, and encamp against the city, and take it; otherwise I myself will take the city, and it will be called by my name.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>12:29</a></td><td class=td>於是大衛聚集眾軍，往拉巴去攻城，就取了這城，<br>So David gathered all the people and went to Rabbah and fought against it and took it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>12:30</a></td><td class=td>奪了亞捫人之王頭上的金冠冕；其上的金子重一他連得，且嵌著寶石。人將這冠冕戴在大衛頭上。大衛帶走了從城裏所奪的許多財物，<br>And he took the crown of their king from off his head. And the weight of it was a talent of gold, and it had precious stones; and it was put upon David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, a very great amount.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>12:31</a></td><td class=td>又將城裏的人拉出來，放在鋸下，或鐵耙下，或鐵斧下，或叫他經過磚窯；大衛待亞捫人的各城都是如此。其後，大衛和眾人都回耶路撒冷去了。<br>And he brought out the people who were in it and set them under saws and iron cutting tools and iron axes and made them pass through the brick kilns; and thus did he do to all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
