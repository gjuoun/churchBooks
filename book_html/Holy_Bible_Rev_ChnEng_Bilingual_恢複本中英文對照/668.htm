<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>9:1</a></td><td class=td>我將這一切事放在心上，詳細考究，就看明義人和智慧人，並他們的作為，都在神手中；或是愛，或是恨，人不能知道；一切都在他們的前麵。<br>For all this I laid on my heart, so that I might explain all this, that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God; man knows neither love nor hate; all is before them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>9:2</a></td><td class=td>凡臨到眾人的事都是一樣：義人和惡人，好人、潔淨人和不潔淨人，獻祭的和不獻祭的，所遭遇的都是一樣。好人如何，罪人也如何；起誓的如何，怕起誓的也如何。<br>All things are alike to all: One thing happens to the righteous man and to the wicked man, to the good and to the clean and to the unclean, to him who sacrifices and to him who does not sacrifice; as the good man is, so is the sinner; he who swears is like him who fears an oath.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>9:3</a></td><td class=td>在日光之下所行的一切事上有一禍患，就是眾人所遭遇的都是一樣；並且世人的心充滿了惡；他們活著的時候心裏狂妄，後來就歸死人那裏去了。<br>This is an evil among all that is done under the sun, that one thing happens to all; moreover the heart of the children of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live; and after that, they go to the dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>9:4</a></td><td class=td>與一切活人相連的，那人還有指望，因為活著的狗比死了的獅子更強。<br>For there is hope for whomever is joined to all the living-surely a living dog is better than a dead lion -</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>9:5</a></td><td class=td>活著的人知道自己必死；死了的人卻毫無所知，也不再得賞賜；他們的名被人遺忘。<br>For the living know that they will die; but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>9:6</a></td><td class=td>他們的愛，他們的恨，他們的嫉妒，早都消滅了；在日光之下所行的一切事上，他們永不再有分了。<br>Their love, their hate, and their envy have already perished, nor do they have some portion yet in all that is done under the sun forever.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>9:7</a></td><td class=td>你隻管去歡歡喜喜吃你的飯，心中快樂喝你的酒，因為神已經悅納你的作為。<br>Go; eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>9:8</a></td><td class=td>你的衣服當時常潔白，你的頭上也不要缺少膏油。<br>Let your garments always be white, and do not let oil be lacking on your head.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>9:9</a></td><td class=td>在你一生虛空的日子，就是神賜你在日光之下一切虛空的日子，當同你所愛的妻子，享受人生，因為那是你一生在日光之下勞碌的事上所得的分。<br>Enjoy life with the wife whom you have loved all the days of your life of vanity which He has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity; for this is your portion in life and in your labor by which you have labored under the sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>9:10</a></td><td class=td>凡你手所當作的事要盡力去作；因為在你所要去的陰間，沒有工作，沒有謀算，沒有知識，也沒有智慧。<br>Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might; for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, where you are going.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>9:11</a></td><td class=td>我又見日光之下快跑的未必能贏，力戰的未必得勝，並且智慧的未必得糧食，聰明的未必得貲財，有知識的也未必得喜悅；所臨到眾人的，是在於時候和機會。<br>Again I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor is the battle to the mighty, nor is even the bread to the wise, nor are riches to those who have understanding, nor is favor to those who have knowledge; but time and chance happen to them all.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>9:12</a></td><td class=td>原來人也不知道自己的時候：魚被惡網圈住，鳥被網羅捉住，禍患忽然臨到的時候，世人陷在其中也是如此。<br>For also man does not know his time: Like fish that are caught in a  deadly net and like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of men are ensnared in an evil time when it falls suddenly on them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>9:13</a></td><td class=td>我也見日光之下有一件事乃是智慧，據我看是大的，<br>This also I have seen as wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>9:14</a></td><td class=td>就是有一小城，其中的人數稀少，有大君王來攻擊，將城圍困，修築高壘攻打。<br>There was a small city with a few men in it; and a great king came against it and surrounded it and built great siegeworks against it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>9:15</a></td><td class=td>城中有一個貧窮的智慧人，他用智慧救了那城，卻沒有人記念那窮人。<br>And in it there was found a poor wise man, and he delivered the city by his wisdom; yet no one remembered that poor man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>9:16</a></td><td class=td>我就說，智慧勝過勇力；然而那貧窮人的智慧被人藐視，他的話也無人聽從。<br>So I said, Wisdom is better than strength; but the wisdom of the poor man is despised, and his words are not heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>9:17</a></td><td class=td>智慧人在安靜中所說的話，比掌權者在愚昧人中的喊聲更有人聽。<br>The words of the wise man spoken quietly are heeded more than the shouting of a ruler among fools.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>9:18</a></td><td class=td>智慧勝過打仗的兵器；但一個罪人能敗壞許多善事。<br>Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
