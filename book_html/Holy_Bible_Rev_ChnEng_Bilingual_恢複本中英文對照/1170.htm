<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>3:2</a></td><td class=td>你要儆醒，堅固那剩下將要衰微的；因我沒有見到你的行為，在我神麵前有一樣是完成的。<br>Become watchful and establish the things which remain, which were about to die; for I have found none of your works completed before My God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>3:3</a></td><td class=td>所以要回想你是怎樣領受，怎樣聽見的，又要遵守，並要悔改。若不儆醒，我必臨到你那裏如同賊一樣。我幾時臨到，你也絕不能知道。<br>Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep it and repent. If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>3:4</a></td><td class=td>然而在撒狄，你還有幾名是未曾玷汙自己衣服的，他們要穿白衣與我同行，因為他們是配得過的。<br>But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white because they are worthy. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>3:5</a></td><td class=td>得勝的，必這樣穿白衣；我也絕不從生命冊上塗抹他的名，並且要在我父麵前，和我父的眾使者麵前，承認他的名。<br>He who overcomes will be clothed thus, in white garments, and I shall by no means erase his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>3:8</a></td><td class=td>我知道你的行為；看哪，我在你麵前給你一個敞開的門，是無人能關的；因為你稍微有一點能力，也曾遵守我的話，沒有否認我的名。<br>I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>3:9</a></td><td class=td>看哪，那撒但會堂的，自稱是猶太人，其實不是猶太人，乃是說謊的；看哪，我要使他們來在你腳前下拜，並使他們知道，我已經愛你了。<br>Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, those who call themselves Jews and are not, but lie -- behold, I will cause them to come and fall prostrate before your feet and to know that I have loved you. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>3:17</a></td><td class=td>因為你說，我是富足，已經發了財，一樣都不缺；卻不知道你是那困苦、可憐、貧窮、瞎眼、赤身的。<br>Because you say, I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>3:18</a></td><td class=td>我勸你向我買火煉的金子，叫你富足；又買白衣穿上，叫你赤身的羞恥不露出來；又買眼藥擦你的眼睛，使你能看見。<br>I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see. </td></tr>
