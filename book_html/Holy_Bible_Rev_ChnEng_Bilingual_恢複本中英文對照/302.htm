<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>11:2</a></td><td class=td>論到這些國民，耶和華曾對以色列人說，你們不可到他們中間去，他們也不可到你們中間來，因為他們必使你們的心偏離，去隨從他們的神。所羅門卻愛戀這些國的女子。<br>From among the nations concerning which Jehovah had said to the children of Israel, You shall not go among them, nor shall they come among you, for they will surely turn your heart after their gods. Solomon clung to these in love.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>11:4</a></td><td class=td>所羅門年老的時候，他的妃嬪使他的心偏離，去隨從別神；他的心就不像他父親大衛的心那樣，完全向著耶和華他的神。<br>And when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect toward Jehovah his God like the heart of David his father.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>11:5</a></td><td class=td>所羅門隨從西頓人的女神亞斯他錄，和亞捫人的可憎之物米勒公。<br>And Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and after Milcom the detestable thing of the Ammonites.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>11:13</a></td><td class=td>隻是我不將全國從你撕去；我要因我仆人大衛和我所選擇的耶路撒冷，將一個支派留給你的兒子。<br>But I will not tear the whole kingdom away from you; I will give one tribe to your son because of David My servant and because of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>11:14</a></td><td class=td>耶和華使以東人哈達興起，作所羅門的對頭；他是以東王的後裔。<br>And Jehovah raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the king's seed in Edom.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>11:18</a></td><td class=td>他們從米甸起行，到了巴蘭；從巴蘭帶著幾個人，來到埃及見埃及王法老；法老給他房屋，為他派定糧食，又給他田地。<br>Thus they arose from Midian and went to Paran, and they took men from Paran with them and went to Egypt, to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who gave him a house and appointed him a portion of food and gave him land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>11:19</a></td><td class=td>哈達在法老眼前大蒙恩惠，以致法老將自己妻子的妹妹，就是王後答比匿的妹妹，賜他為妻。<br>And Hadad found so much favor in the sight of Pharaoh that Pharaoh gave him the sister of his wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen, as his wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>11:20</a></td><td class=td>答比匿的妹妹給哈達生了兒子基努拔；答比匿使基努拔在法老的宮裏斷奶，基努拔就在法老的宮裏，在法老的眾子中生活。<br>And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, and Tahpenes weaned him in Pharaoh's house, and Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among Pharaoh's sons.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>11:21</a></td><td class=td>哈達在埃及聽見大衛與他列祖同睡，元帥約押也死了，就對法老說，求你讓我離開，往我本地去。<br>And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart that I may go to my own land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>11:22</a></td><td class=td>法老對他說，你在我這裏有什麼缺乏，竟想要往你本地去呢？他說，我沒有缺乏什麼，隻是求你讓我離去。<br>But Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked while with me that now you are seeking to go to your own land? And he said, Nothing; only let me depart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>11:23</a></td><td class=td>神又使以利亞大的兒子利遜興起，作所羅門的對頭；他先前逃避主人瑣巴王哈大底謝。<br>And God raised up another adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord, Hadadezer the king of Zobah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>11:24</a></td><td class=td>大衛擊殺瑣巴人的時候，利遜招聚了一群人在身邊，自己作他們的頭目，往大馬色居住，在那裏作王。<br>And he gathered men to himself and became the captain of the band when David slew those of Zobah; and they went to Damascus and dwelt there; and they reigned in Damascus.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>11:25</a></td><td class=td>所羅門在世的一切日子，哈達為患之外，利遜也作以色列的對頭；他恨惡以色列人，且作了亞蘭人的王。<br>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon in addition to the evil that Hadad did; and he abhorred Israel and reigned over Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>11:26</a></td><td class=td>所羅門的臣仆，尼八的兒子耶羅波安也舉手攻擊王；他是洗利達的以法蓮人，他母親是寡婦，名叫洗魯阿。<br>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, also a widow, lifted up his hand against the king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>11:27</a></td><td class=td>他舉手攻擊王的緣故是這樣：先前所羅門建造米羅，修補他父親大衛的城的破口。<br>And this was the reason he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon was building the Millo, closing up the breach of the city of David his father.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>11:28</a></td><td class=td>耶羅波安是個有才能的人；所羅門見這少年人殷勤，就派他監管約瑟家一切服苦役的人。<br>And the man Jeroboam was an able man; and Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, so he set him over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>11:29</a></td><td class=td>那時，有一次耶羅波安出了耶路撒冷，示羅人申言者亞希雅在路上遇見他。亞希雅穿著一件新衣；他們二人在田野，以外並無別人。<br>And at that time Jeroboam went forth from Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the way. And  Ahijah was wearing a new garment, and the two of them were alone in the field.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>11:31</a></td><td class=td>對耶羅波安說，你給自己拿十片；因為耶和華以色列的神如此說，我必將國從所羅門手裏撕去，將十個支派賜給你，<br>And he said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces for yourself; for thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, I am now tearing the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and giving the ten tribes to you</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>11:32</a></td><td class=td>(但因我仆人大衛，和我在以色列眾支派中所選擇的耶路撒冷城的緣故，所羅門仍然可以有一個支派，)<br>(But the one tribe will be his because of My servant David and because of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel),</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>11:33</a></td><td class=td>因為他們離棄我，敬拜西頓人的女神亞斯他錄、摩押的神基抹、和亞捫人的神米勒公，沒有遵行我的道路，行我眼中看為正的事，守我的律例和典章，像他父親大衛一樣。<br>Because they have forsaken Me and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and Chemosh the god of Moab and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon and have not walked in My ways by doing what is upright in My sight and by keeping My statutes and My ordinances as David his father did.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>11:34</a></td><td class=td>但我不從他手裏將全國奪去；我必使他終身為君，這是因著我所揀選的仆人大衛的緣故，因他謹守我的誡命和律例。<br>But I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him leader all the days of his life because of David My servant, whom I chose and who kept My commandments and My statutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>11:35</a></td><td class=td>我必從他兒子的手裏將國奪去，把這國十個支派賜給你，<br>Yet I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand and will give it to you, that is, the ten tribes;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>11:36</a></td><td class=td>還將一個支派留給他的兒子，使我仆人大衛在我所選擇立我名的耶路撒冷城裏，在我麵前一直有燈光。<br>And to his son I will give one tribe, that My servant David may have a lamp always before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put My name.</td></tr>
