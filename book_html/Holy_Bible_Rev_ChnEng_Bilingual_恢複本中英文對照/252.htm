<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>16:1</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對撒母耳說，我既厭棄掃羅作以色列的王，你為他悲傷要到幾時呢？你將膏油盛滿了角，我差遣你往伯利恒人耶西那裏去；因為我已在他眾子之中，為自己看定一個作王的。<br>And Jehovah said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, though I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have  for Myself a king among his sons.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>16:2</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳說，我怎能去呢？掃羅若聽見，必要殺我。耶和華說，你可以牽一隻母牛犢去，說，我來是要向耶和華獻祭。<br>And Samuel said, How can I go? If Saul hears  of  it, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with you, and say, I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>16:3</a></td><td class=td>你要請耶西來赴獻祭的筵席，我必指示你當行的事。我所指給你的人，你要為我膏他。<br>Then call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will make known to you what you shall do. And you shall anoint for Me the one whom I name to you.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>16:5</a></td><td class=td>他說，是為平安；我來是要向耶和華獻祭。你們當使自己分別為聖，來與我同赴獻祭的筵席。撒母耳就使耶西和他眾子分別為聖，請他們來赴獻祭的筵席。<br>And he said, Peaceably. I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah. Sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>16:7</a></td><td class=td>耶和華卻對撒母耳說，不要看他的外貌和他身材高大，我不揀選他。因為要緊的不是人怎樣看；人是看外貌，耶和華是看內心。<br>But Jehovah said to Samuel, Do not regard his appearance and the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For  it is not how man sees  that matters; for man looks on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looks on the heart.</td></tr>

And he said, There is still the youngest, but he is now tending the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send for  him, and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>16:12</a></td><td class=td>耶西就打發人去帶了他來。他麵色紅潤，雙目清秀，容貌俊美。耶和華說，這就是他，你起來膏他。<br>So he sent for  him and brought him in. Now he was ruddy  and had beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. And Jehovah said, Arise; anoint him, for this is he.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>16:13</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳就拿起盛膏油的角，在他諸兄中膏了他；從那日起，耶和華的靈就衝擊大衛。於是撒母耳起身往拉瑪去了。<br>And Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers, and the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon David from that day forward. Then Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>16:16</a></td><td class=td>願我們的主吩咐你麵前的臣仆，找一個善於彈琴的人來；從神那裏來的惡靈臨到你身上的時候，他用手彈琴，你就好了。<br>Let our lord speak. Your servants are before you; they will seek out a man who is skilled in playing the lyre. And when the evil spirit from God is upon you, he will play  it by hand, and you will be well.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>16:19</a></td><td class=td>於是掃羅差遣使者去見耶西，說，請你打發你放羊的兒子大衛到我這裏來。<br>So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, Send me David your son, who is among the sheep.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>16:20</a></td><td class=td>耶西就牽來一頭驢，馱上餅，和一皮袋酒，並一隻山羊羔，交在他兒子大衛手中，送與掃羅。<br>And Jesse took a donkey  laden with bread and a skin of wine and a kid, and sent  them by David his son to Saul.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>16:21</a></td><td class=td>大衛到了掃羅那裏，就侍立在掃羅麵前。掃羅甚喜愛他，他就作了掃羅拿兵器的人。<br>And David came to Saul and entered his service. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor bearer.</td></tr>
