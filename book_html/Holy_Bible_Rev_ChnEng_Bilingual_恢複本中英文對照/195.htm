Take all the people of war with you, and rise and go up to Ai. See, I have given the king of Ai and his people and his city and his land into your hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>8:2</a></td><td class=td>你怎樣待耶利哥和耶利哥的王，也當照樣待艾城和艾城的王；隻是城內所奪的財物和牲畜，你們可以取為自己的掠物。你要在城後設下攻城的伏兵。<br>And you shall do to Ai and to its king as you did to Jericho and to its king; except its spoil and its cattle you shall take for your plunder. Set an ambush for the city behind it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>8:3</a></td><td class=td>於是，約書亞和一切兵丁都起來，要上艾城去。約書亞選了三萬人，都是大能的勇士，夜間打發他們前往，<br>So Joshua rose up with all the people of war to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose thirty thousand men, mighty men of valor, and sent them out by night.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>8:4</a></td><td class=td>吩咐他們說，你們要注意，要在城後埋伏，等候攻城；不可離城太遠，都要各自準備。<br>And he commanded them, saying, See, you shall lie in ambush for the city behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, and all of you be ready.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>8:5</a></td><td class=td>我與我所帶領的眾民要向城進迫。城裏的人像初次出來攻擊我們的時候，我們就在他們麵前逃跑。<br>And I and all the people who are with me will draw near to the city. Then when they come forth to meet us, as it was the first time, we will flee before them.</td></tr>

Thus we will flee before them.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>8:16</a></td><td class=td>城內的眾民都被召集，追趕他們；艾城人追趕約書亞的時候，就被引誘離開城。<br>Then all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them; and they pursued after Joshua and thus were drawn out of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>8:17</a></td><td class=td>艾城和伯特利城沒有留下一人不出來追趕以色列人的；他們撇了敞開的城，去追趕以色列人。<br>And not a man was left in Ai or in Bethel who did not go forth after Israel, but they abandoned the city, leaving it open, and pursued after Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>8:18</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對約書亞說，你向艾城伸出手裏的短槍，因為我要將城交在你手裏。約書亞就向城伸出手裏的短槍。<br>Then Jehovah said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>8:22</a></td><td class=td>伏兵也出城迎擊艾城人，艾城人就困在以色列人中間，前後都是以色列人。於是以色列人擊殺他們，沒有留下一個，也沒有讓一個逃脫。<br>And the others came out from the city to meet them, so that they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side.
