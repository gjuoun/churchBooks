<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>5:1</a></td><td class=td>百姓和他們的妻子大大呼號，埋怨他們的弟兄猶大人。<br>And there was a great cry of the people and their wives against their brothers the Jews,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>5:2</a></td><td class=td>有的說，我們和兒女人口眾多，要去得糧食吃飽活命；<br>For there were some who said, With our sons and our daughters we are many; therefore we must get grain that we may eat and live.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>5:3</a></td><td class=td>有的說，我們典了田地、葡萄園、房屋，要在饑荒中得糧食；<br>And there were some who said, We have pledged our fields and our vineyards and our houses that we might get grain in this famine.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>5:4</a></td><td class=td>有的說，我們已經用田地、葡萄園作抵押，借了錢給王納稅。<br>And there were some who said, We have borrowed money against our fields and our vineyards for the king's tribute.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>5:5</a></td><td class=td>其實我們的肉身與我們弟兄的肉身一樣，我們的兒女與他們的兒女一般；看哪，我們將要使兒女作人的仆婢。我們的女兒已有為婢的；我們無力拯救，因為我們的田地、葡萄園，已經歸了別人。<br>Yet now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our children like their children; and now we are bringing our sons and daughters into bondage as slaves. And some of our daughters have already been brought into bondage; and it is not in our power to deliver them, for our fields and vineyards belong to others.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>5:6</a></td><td class=td>我聽見他們的呼號和這些話，便甚發怒。<br>And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>5:7</a></td><td class=td>我心裏籌畫了，就斥責貴胄和官長，說，你們各人竟向自己的弟兄索取利息！於是我安排大會攻擊他們。<br>And when I had considered this matter in my heart, I rebuked the nobles and the rulers and said to them, You men are charging interest, each man against his brother! And I set a great assembly against them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>5:8</a></td><td class=td>我對他們說，我們盡力贖回了我們的弟兄，就是賣與外邦的猶大人；你們還要賣弟兄，使我們贖回來麼？他們靜默不語，無話可答。<br>And I said to them, We have bought back our brothers the Jews who have been sold to the nations according to the best of our ability. So would you even sell your brothers that they would have to be sold back to us? And they held their peace and could find not a word to answer.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>5:9</a></td><td class=td>我又說，你們所行的不善。為著避免我們仇敵外邦人的毀謗，你們行事不當敬畏我們的神麼？<br>Then I said, The thing that you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>5:10</a></td><td class=td>我和我的弟兄與仆人也將銀錢糧食借給百姓；我們大家都放棄收取利息罷。<br>And even I, my brothers, and my servants lend them money and grain. Let us now abandon such taking of interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>5:11</a></td><td class=td>如今我勸你們將他們的田地、葡萄園、橄欖園、房屋，並向他們所取的銀錢、糧食、新酒和新油，百分之一的利息，都歸還他們。<br>Restore now to them, as of today, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, as well as the hundredth part of the money and of the grain, new wine, and fresh oil that you charge them as interest.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>5:12</a></td><td class=td>眾人說，我們必歸還，不向他們索要，必照你所說的去行。我就召了祭司來，叫眾人起誓，必照著所應許的去行。<br>And they said, We will restore it, and we will require nothing from them; so will we do, even as you say. Then I called for the priests and took an oath from them that they would do according to this promise.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>5:13</a></td><td class=td>我也抖著胸前的衣襟，說，凡不成就這應許的，願神照樣抖他離開家產和他勞碌得來的，直到抖空了。會眾都說，阿們；又讚美耶和華。百姓就照著所應許的去行。<br>I also shook out the lap of my garment and said, May God shake out in the same way every man from his house and from his possessions who does not perform this promise; even so may he be shaken out and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen; and they praised Jehovah. And the people acted according to this promise.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>5:14</a></td><td class=td>自從王派我作猶大地的省長，就是從亞達薛西王二十年，直到三十二年，共十二年之久，我與我弟兄都沒有吃省長的俸祿。<br>Moreover from the time that the king appointed me to be governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, I and my brothers did not eat the food appointed for the governor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>5:15</a></td><td class=td>在我以前的省長加重百姓的擔子，除了征收銀子四十舍客勒以外，又索要糧食和酒，就是他們的仆人也轄製百姓；但我因敬畏神，不這樣行。<br>But the former governors, who were before me, laid heavy burdens on the people and took from them food and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; even their servants tyrannized the people. But I did not do so, because of the fear of God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>5:16</a></td><td class=td>並且我堅定持續作城牆的工，並沒有置買田地；我的仆人也都聚集在那裏作工。<br>And I also applied myself to the work on this wall. And we did not acquire fields, and all my servants were gathered there for the work.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>5:17</a></td><td class=td>除了從四圍外邦中到我們這裏來的人以外，有猶大平民和官長一百五十人，在我席上吃飯。<br>And there were at my table one hundred fifty men, Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from the nations that surrounded us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>5:18</a></td><td class=td>每日豫備的有一隻公牛，六隻肥羊，又為我豫備一些飛禽；每十日一次，多豫備各樣的酒。雖然如此，我並不要省長的俸祿，因為百姓服役甚重。<br>And what was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowl was prepared for me, as well as all kinds of wine in abundance every ten days. Yet for this I did not demand the food appointed for the governor, for the service was heavy upon this people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>5:19</a></td><td class=td>我的神阿，求你記念我為這百姓所行的一切事，以善待我。<br>Remember me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
