<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>25:2</a></td><td class=td>祭司長和猶太人的首領，向他控告保羅，<br>And the chief priests and leading men of the Jews gave their information to him against Paul; and they entreated him, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>25:3</a></td><td class=td>不斷懇求非斯都，向他求情對付保羅，將他提到耶路撒冷來，他們要在路上埋伏殺害他。<br>Asking for a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem, they themselves setting an ambush to do away with him on the way. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>25:4</a></td><td class=td>非斯都就回答說，保羅押在該撒利亞，我不久就要親自往那裏去。<br>Festus therefore answered that Paul was being kept in custody in Caesarea, and that he himself was about to proceed there shortly. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>25:5</a></td><td class=td>又說，你們中間有權勢的人與我一同下去，那人若有什麼不是，就可以告他。<br>Therefore, he said, let influential men from among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>25:6</a></td><td class=td>非斯都在他們中間，住了不過十天八天，就下該撒利亞去，第二天坐在審判台上，吩咐將保羅提上來。<br>And having stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>25:7</a></td><td class=td>保羅來了，那些從耶路撒冷下來的猶太人，圍繞他站著，提出許多嚴重的事控告他，都是他們不能證實的。<br>And when he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they were not able to prove, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>25:8</a></td><td class=td>保羅分訴說，無論猶太人的律法，或是聖殿，或是該撒，我都沒有得罪過。<br>While Paul said in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I sinned in anything. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>25:9</a></td><td class=td>但非斯都要討好猶太人，就回答保羅說，關於這些事，你願意上耶路撒冷去，在那裏在我麵前受審麼？<br>But Festus, wanting to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before me concerning these things? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>25:10</a></td><td class=td>保羅說，我是站在該撒的審判台前，這是我應當受審的地方；我向猶太人並沒有行過什麼不對的事，這也是你明明知道的。<br>And Paul said, I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>25:11</a></td><td class=td>我若行了不對的事，犯了什麼該死的罪，就是死，我也不辭；但他們所告我的事，若都是虛的，就沒有人可以把我交給他們。我上訴於該撒。<br>If therefore I am doing wrong and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if there is nothing to the things which these accuse me of, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>25:12</a></td><td class=td>非斯都和議會商量了，就回答說，你既上訴於該撒，就要往該撒那裏去。<br>Then when Festus had conferred with the council, he answered, To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>25:13</a></td><td class=td>過了些日子，亞基帕王和百尼基氏來到該撒利亞，問候非斯都。<br>Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>25:14</a></td><td class=td>他們在那裏住了多日，非斯都將保羅的事向王陳述說，這裏有一個人，是腓力斯留下來的囚犯。<br>And while they were staying some additional days there, Festus laid before the king the matters regarding Paul, saying, There is a certain man who has been left a prisoner by Felix, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>25:15</a></td><td class=td>我在耶路撒冷的時候，祭司長和猶太人的長老，將他的事稟報了我，求我定他的罪。<br>Concerning whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews gave information and asked for a sentence against him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>25:16</a></td><td class=td>我回答他們說，無論什麼人，被告還沒有和原告當麵對質，未得機會分訴所告他的事，就先把他交給對方，這不是羅馬人的規例。<br>To them I answered that it is not the custom with Romans to hand over any man before he who is accused meets the accusers face to face and has an opportunity for a defense concerning the charge. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>25:17</a></td><td class=td>及至他們都來到這裏，我就不耽延，第二天便坐在審判台上，吩咐把那人提上來。<br>So when they had come together here, I made no delay; on the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, I ordered the man to be brought. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>25:18</a></td><td class=td>原告站著告他，所告的並沒有我所意料的惡事；<br>Concerning him the accusers stood and brought no charge of the evil things I was suspecting. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>25:19</a></td><td class=td>不過是和保羅爭論一些他們自己敬鬼神的問題，又關於一位已經死了的耶穌，保羅斷言祂是活著的。<br>But they had certain questions against him concerning their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>25:20</a></td><td class=td>關於這些爭論，我心裏作難，就問他願不願意上耶路撒冷去，在那裏為這些事受審。<br>And being at a loss as to how there should be an inquiry concerning these things, I asked him if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and be judged there concerning these things. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>25:21</a></td><td class=td>但保羅訴求把他留下，等待皇上審斷，我就吩咐把他留下，等我解他到該撒那裏去。<br>But when Paul appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I should send him up to Caesar. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>25:22</a></td><td class=td>亞基帕對非斯都說，我也願意親自聽聽這個人。非斯都說，明天你可以聽他。<br>And Agrippa said to Festus, I myself also would like to hear the man. Tomorrow, said Festus, you shall hear him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>25:23</a></td><td class=td>第二天，亞基帕和百尼基大張威勢而來，同著眾千夫長和城裏傑出的人，進了廳堂；非斯都吩咐一聲，就有人將保羅提上來。<br>Therefore on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered into the hall of audience together with the commanders and prominent men of the city, and when Festus had given the order, Paul was brought. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>25:24</a></td><td class=td>非斯都說，亞基帕王和同我們在座的諸位，你們看這人，為了他，耶路撒冷和這裏全群的猶太人曾向我懇求，嚷著說，這個人不該再活著。<br>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all you men who are present with us, you behold this man, concerning whom all the multitude of Jews have petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>25:25</a></td><td class=td>但我查明他沒有犯什麼該死的罪，並且他自己既然要上訴於皇上，我就定意把他解去。<br>But I found that he had done nothing worthy of death; and since he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>25:26</a></td><td class=td>論到這人，我沒有確實的事可以呈奏主上；因此我帶他到你們麵前，也特意帶他到你亞基帕王麵前，為要在審問之後，有所陳奏。<br>Concerning him I have nothing definite to write to my lord; therefore I have brought him before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that when the examination has taken place, I may have something to write. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>25:27</a></td><td class=td>據我看來，解送囚犯，不指明他的罪狀，是不合理的。<br>For it seems unreasonable to me, in sending a prisoner, not to also signify the charges against him. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
