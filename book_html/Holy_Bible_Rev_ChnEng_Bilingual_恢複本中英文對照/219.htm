<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>8:2</a></td><td class=td>基甸對他們說，現在我行了什麼能與你們相比呢？以法蓮所拾取剩下的葡萄，不強過亞比以謝所摘收的葡萄麼？<br>And he said to them, What have I done now to compare with you? Are not the gleanings of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>8:3</a></td><td class=td>神已將米甸的首領俄立和西伊伯交在你們手中；我能行什麼與你們相比呢？基甸說了這話，以法蓮人向他的怒氣就消了。<br>It was into your hand that God gave the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their hostile spirit toward him subsided when he said this word.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>8:15</a></td><td class=td>基甸到了疏割，對那裏的人說，看哪，西巴和撒慕拿在這裏；你們曾指著他們譏誚我說，難道西巴和撒慕拿已經在你手裏，所以我們該將餅給跟隨你的疲乏人麼？<br>Then he came to the men of Succoth and said, Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your hand now, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>8:16</a></td><td class=td>於是捉住那城的長老，並拿野地的荊條和枳棘來，用以踹踏疏割人；<br>And he took the elders of the city and the thorns of the wilderness and the briers, and with them he  trampled the men of Succoth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>8:17</a></td><td class=td>又拆了毗努伊勒的樓，殺了那城裏的人。<br>And he broke down the tower of Penuel and slew the men of the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>8:18</a></td><td class=td>基甸問西巴和撒慕拿說，你們在他泊山所殺的人是什麼樣子？他們說，你是什麼樣子，他們也是什麼樣子；每一個都像王子的模樣。<br>Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, What were the men whom you slew in Tabor like?

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>8:19</a></td><td class=td>基甸說，他們是我同母的兄弟，我指著永活的耶和華起誓，你們從前若存留他們的性命，我如今就不殺你們了。<br>And he said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As Jehovah lives, if you had kept them alive, I would not slay you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>8:20</a></td><td class=td>於是對他的長子益帖說，你起來殺他們。但那童子害怕，不敢拔刀，因為他還是個童子。<br>And he said to Jether his firstborn, Rise up; slay them. But the youth would not draw his sword, because he was fearful; for he was still a youth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>8:21</a></td><td class=td>西巴和撒慕拿說，你自己起來殺我們罷，因為人如何，力量也如何。基甸就起來，殺了西巴和撒慕拿，奪了他們駱駝項上戴的月牙圈。<br>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, You rise up, and fall on us; for there is as much strength as there is man. And Gideon rose up and slew Zebah and Zalmunna. And he took the crescents that were on their camels' necks.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>8:22</a></td><td class=td>以色列人對基甸說，你既救我們脫離米甸人的手，願你和你的兒孫管理我們。<br>And the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson as well; for you have saved us from the hand of Midian.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>8:27</a></td><td class=td>基甸以此製造了一個以弗得，設立在本城俄弗拉。後來全以色列在那裏隨從這以弗得行了邪淫；這就作了基甸和他全家的網羅。<br>And Gideon made an ephod with it and placed it in his city, in Ophrah. And all Israel went as harlots to it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>8:28</a></td><td class=td>這樣，米甸人在以色列人麵前被製伏了，不能再抬起頭來。基甸還在的日子，那地太平四十年。<br>So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.</td></tr>
