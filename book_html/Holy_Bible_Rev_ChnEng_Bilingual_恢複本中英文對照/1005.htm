<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>8:6</a></td><td class=td>他們說這話，是要試誘耶穌，好得著把柄告祂。耶穌卻彎下腰來，用指頭在地上寫字。<br>But they said this to tempt Him, so that they might have reason to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote with His finger on the ground. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>8:7</a></td><td class=td>他們還是不住的問祂，耶穌就直起腰來，對他們說，你們中間誰是沒有罪的，誰就先拿石頭打她。<br>But when they persisted in questioning Him, He stood up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>8:8</a></td><td class=td>於是又彎下腰來，在地上寫字。<br>And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>8:10</a></td><td class=td>耶穌就直起腰來，對她說，婦人，那些人在那裏？沒有人定你的罪麼？<br>And Jesus stood up and said to her, Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you? </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>8:19</a></td><td class=td>他們就問祂說，你的父在那裏？耶穌回答說，你們不認識我，也不認識我的父；你們若認識我，也就認識我的父。<br>They said then to Him, Where is Your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>8:20</a></td><td class=td>這些話是耶穌在殿裏施教的時候，在銀庫那裏說的，也沒有人拿祂，因為祂的時候還沒有到。<br>These words He spoke in the treasury as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>8:21</a></td><td class=td>耶穌又對他們說，我要去了，你們要尋找我，並且你們要死在你們的罪中；我所去的地方，你們不能到。<br>He said therefore again to them, I am going away, and you will seek Me and will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>8:22</a></td><td class=td>猶太人就說，祂說我所去的地方，你們不能到，難道祂要自殺麼？<br>The Jews then said, He is not going to kill Himself, is He, for He says, Where I am going, you cannot come? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>8:23</a></td><td class=td>耶穌對他們說，你們是出於下頭的，我是出於上頭的；你們是屬這世界的，我不是屬這世界的。<br>And He said to them, You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>8:24</a></td><td class=td>所以我對你們說，你們要死在你們的罪中；你們若不信我是，必要死在你們的罪中。<br>Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>8:28</a></td><td class=td>所以耶穌對他們說，你們舉起人子以後，必知道我是，並且知道我不從自己作什麼；我說這些話，乃是照著父所教訓我的。<br>Jesus therefore said to them, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am, and that I do nothing from Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>8:29</a></td><td class=td>那差我來的是與我同在，祂沒有撇下我獨自一人，因為我始終作祂所喜悅的事。<br>And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>8:30</a></td><td class=td>耶穌說這些話的時候，就有許多人信入了祂。<br>As He spoke these things, many believed into Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>8:31</a></td><td class=td>耶穌對信祂的猶太人說，你們若住在我的話裏，就真是我的門徒；<br>Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, If you abide in My word, you are truly My disciples; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>8:32</a></td><td class=td>你們必認識真理，真理必叫你們得以自由。<br>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>8:33</a></td><td class=td>他們回答祂說，我們是亞伯拉罕的後裔，從來沒有被誰奴役過；你怎麼說，你們必得以自由？<br>They answered Him, We are Abraham's seed and have never yet been enslaved to anyone. How is it that You say, You shall become free? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>8:34</a></td><td class=td>耶穌回答他們說，我實實在在的告訴你們，凡犯罪的，就是罪的奴仆。<br>Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>8:35</a></td><td class=td>奴仆不永遠住在家裏，兒子是永遠住在家裏。<br>And the slave does not abide in the house forever; the son does abide forever. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>8:36</a></td><td class=td>所以神的兒子若叫你們自由，你們就真自由了。<br>If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>8:37</a></td><td class=td>我知道你們是亞伯拉罕的後裔；你們卻想要殺我，因為你們裏麵容不下我的話。<br>I know that you are Abraham's seed; but you seek to kill Me because My word has no place in you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>8:38</a></td><td class=td>我所說的，是在我父那裏看見的；你們所行的，是從你們的父聽見的。<br>I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; so then, you also do the things which you have heard from your father. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>8:39</a></td><td class=td>他們回答祂說，我們的父就是亞伯拉罕。耶穌對他們說，你們若是亞伯拉罕的子孫，就必行亞伯拉罕所作的。<br>They answered and said to Him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=40>8:40</a></td><td class=td>現在你們卻想要殺我這個將從神所聽見的真理，對你們講了的人！這不是亞伯拉罕所行的。<br>But now you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; Abraham did not do this. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=41>8:41</a></td><td class=td>你們是行你們父所作的。他們對祂說，我們不是從淫亂生的；我們隻有一位父，就是神。<br>You do the works of your father. They then said to Him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=42>8:42</a></td><td class=td>耶穌對他們說，倘若神是你們的父，你們就必愛我；因為我是出於神而前來的，並且已經來了。我不是從自己來的，乃是祂差了我來。<br>Jesus said to them, If God were your Father you would love Me; for I came forth out from God and have come from Him; for I have not come of Myself, but He sent Me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=43>8:43</a></td><td class=td>你們為什麼不明白我的講說？無非是因你們不能聽我的話。<br>Why do you not understand My speaking? It is because you cannot hear My word. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=44>8:44</a></td><td class=td>你們是出於那父魔鬼，你們父的私欲，你們願意行。他從起初就是殺人的，並且不站在真理中，因為在他裏麵沒有真理。他說謊是出於他自己的私有物，因他是說謊的，也是說謊者的父。<br>You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks it out of his own possessions; for he is a liar and the father of it. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=45>8:45</a></td><td class=td>我講真理，你們卻因此不信我。<br>But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=46>8:46</a></td><td class=td>你們中間誰能指證我有罪？我既然講真理，你們為什麼不信我？<br>Which of you convicts Me of sin? Since I speak truth, why do you not believe Me? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=47>8:47</a></td><td class=td>出於神的，必聽神的話；你們所以不聽，因為你們不是出於神。<br>He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=48>8:48</a></td><td class=td>猶太人回答祂說，我們說你是撒瑪利亞人，又有鬼附著，豈不正對麼？<br>The Jews answered and said to Him, Have we not spoken well in saying that You are a Samaritan and have a demon? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=49>8:49</a></td><td class=td>耶穌回答說，我沒有鬼附著，我尊敬我的父，你們倒侮辱我。<br>Jesus answered, I do not have a demon, but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=50>8:50</a></td><td class=td>然而我不尋求自己的榮耀，有一位為我尋求榮耀並審判人的。<br>But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks glory for Me and judges. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=52>8:52</a></td><td class=td>猶太人對祂說，現在我們知道你有鬼附著。亞伯拉罕死了，眾申言者也死了，你還說人若遵守我的話，必永遠不嚐死味。<br>The Jews therefore said to Him, Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets too; yet You say, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means taste death forever. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=53>8:53</a></td><td class=td>難道你比我們的祖宗亞伯拉罕還大麼？他死了，眾申言者也死了。你將自己當作什麼人？<br>Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too. Who are You making Yourself? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=54>8:54</a></td><td class=td>耶穌回答說，我若榮耀自己，我的榮耀就算不得什麼，榮耀我的乃是我的父，就是你們所說是你們神的那一位。<br>Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is your God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=55>8:55</a></td><td class=td>你們未曾認識祂，我卻認識祂。我若說不認識祂，我就是說謊的，像你們一樣，但我認識祂，也遵守祂的話。<br>Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I say that I do not know Him, I will be like you, a liar; but I do know Him and I keep His word. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=56>8:56</a></td><td class=td>你們的祖宗亞伯拉罕歡騰的要見我的日子，既看見了，就歡樂。<br>Your father Abraham exulted that he would see My day, and he saw it and rejoiced. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=57>8:57</a></td><td class=td>於是猶太人對祂說，你還沒有五十歲，豈見過亞伯拉罕？<br>The Jews then said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham? </td></tr>
