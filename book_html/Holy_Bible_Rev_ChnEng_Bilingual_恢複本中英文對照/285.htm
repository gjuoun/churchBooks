<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>18:1</a></td><td class=td>大衛點閱跟隨他的人，立千夫長、百夫長率領他們。<br>Then David mustered the people who were with him, and he set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>18:2</a></td><td class=td>大衛打發百姓出戰，三分之一在約押手下，三分之一在洗魯雅的兒子，約押兄弟亞比篩手下，三分之一在迦特人以太手下。王對百姓說，我也必親自與你們一同出戰。<br>And David sent the people out, a third under the hand of Joab and a third under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I myself will surely go forth with you also.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>18:3</a></td><td class=td>百姓卻說，你不可出戰。若是我們逃跑，敵人必不介意；我們陣亡一半，敵人也不介意。但是你一人強似我們萬人，所以你不如在城裏幫助我們。<br>But the people said, You shall not go forth; for if we flee off, they will not care about us; and if half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us; therefore it is better for you to be  available to help us from the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>18:4</a></td><td class=td>王向他們說，你們看怎麼好，我就怎麼行。於是王站在城門旁，眾百姓百人一隊或千人一隊的出去了。<br>And the king said to them, What seems best in your sight I will do. So the king stood at the side of the gate, and all the people went forth by hundreds and by thousands.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>18:5</a></td><td class=td>王囑咐約押、亞比篩、以太說，你們要為我的緣故寬待那少年人押沙龍。王為押沙龍囑咐眾將的話，百姓都聽見了。<br>And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave the command to all the captains concerning Absalom.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>18:6</a></td><td class=td>百姓出到田野迎著以色列人，在以法蓮樹林裏交戰。<br>And the people went forth into the field against Israel, and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>18:7</a></td><td class=td>以色列人敗在大衛的仆人麵前；當日在那裏陣亡的甚多，共有二萬人。<br>And the people of Israel were struck there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter of twenty thousand there on that day.</td></tr>

And the mule went under the tangled branches of a great tree; and his head was caught in the tree, and he was left hanging between heaven and earth while the mule that was under him went on.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>18:11</a></td><td class=td>約押對告訴他的人說，你既看見了，為什麼不在那裏將他打死落在地上呢？那樣，我會賞你十錠銀子和一條腰帶。<br>And Joab said to the man who told him  this, And you have just seen  this. Why did you not strike him down to the ground there? For I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a belt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>18:12</a></td><td class=td>那人對約押說，我就是手中得你一千錠銀子，也不敢伸手害王的兒子；因為我們聽見王囑咐你和亞比篩並以太，說，你們無論誰都要顧全那少年人押沙龍。<br>And the man said to Joab, Though I would receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I would not put forth my hand against the son of the king; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take care of the young man Absalom, whoever  you be.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>18:13</a></td><td class=td>我若妄為不忠，害了他的性命，就是你自己也必與我為敵，因為無論何事都瞞不過王。<br>On the other hand, if I had dealt treacherously with his life (there is nothing hidden from the king), you would have set yourself against  me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>18:14</a></td><td class=td>約押說，我不能這樣與你留連。約押手拿三根短槍，趁押沙龍在橡樹上還活著，就刺透他的心。<br>Then Joab said, I will not linger here with you. And he took three staves in his hand and thrust them through Absalom's heart while he was still alive in the midst of the tree.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>18:17</a></td><td class=td>他們將押沙龍丟在林中一個大坑裏，上頭立起一大堆石頭。全以色列的人都逃跑，各人回自己的帳棚去了。<br>And they took Absalom and threw him into a great pit in the forest, and they cast up over him a very great mound of stones. And all Israel fled, every man to his tent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>18:18</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍活著的時候，在王穀為自己立了一根石柱，因他說，我沒有兒子為我留名作記念。他就以自己的名稱那石柱叫押沙龍記念碑，直到今日。<br>Now Absalom, while he was alive, had taken a pillar which was in the king's valley and raised  it up for himself, for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>18:20</a></td><td class=td>約押對他說，你今日不可作報信的人，改日可以報信；今日你不可報信，因為王的兒子死了。<br>And Joab said to him, You shall not be the bearer of the news this day, but you shall announce the news on another day; yet on this day you shall not announce the news, for the king's son is dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>18:21</a></td><td class=td>約押對古實人說，你去將你所看見的告訴王。古實人向約押下拜，就跑去了。<br>And Joab said to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what you have seen. And the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>18:22</a></td><td class=td>撒督的兒子亞希瑪斯又對約押說，無論怎樣，求你也讓我隨著古實人跑去。約押說，我兒，你報這信息，既不得賞賜，何必要跑去呢？<br>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will have no reward for the news?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>18:23</a></td><td class=td>他又說，無論怎樣，我要跑去。約押說，你跑去罷。亞希瑪斯就沿平原的路跑去，趕過了古實人。<br>But come what may, he said, I will run. And he said to him, Run. And Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and passed the Cushite.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>18:24</a></td><td class=td>大衛正坐在內外城門之間。守望的人走到城門樓的平頂，到了城牆上，舉目觀看，見有一個人獨自跑來。<br>Now David was sitting between the two gates.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>18:25</a></td><td class=td>守望的人就呼叫著告訴王。王說，他若獨自一個人，必是要親口報信的。那人跑得漸漸近了。<br>And the watchman called out and told the king. And the king said, If he is alone, there is news in his mouth. And he continued coming and drew near.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>18:26</a></td><td class=td>守望的人又見一個人跑來，就對守城門的人呼叫說，又有一個人獨自跑來。王說，這也必是報信的。<br>Then the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called out to the gatekeeper and said, Here comes a man running alone. And the king said, This one also brings news.</td></tr>
