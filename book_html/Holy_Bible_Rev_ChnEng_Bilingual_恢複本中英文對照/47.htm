<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>47:2</a></td><td class=td>約瑟從他眾弟兄中挑出五個人來，引他們去見法老。<br>And he took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>47:3</a></td><td class=td>法老問約瑟的弟兄們說，你們以何事為業？他們對法老說，你仆人們是牧羊的，我們和我們的祖宗都是如此。<br>And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>47:4</a></td><td class=td>他們又對法老說，迦南地的饑荒甚重，那裏沒有草場供應你仆人們的羊群，所以我們來到這地寄居。現在求你讓仆人們住在歌珊地。<br>And they said to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land because there is no pasture for your servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>47:5</a></td><td class=td>法老對約瑟說，你父親和你弟兄們到你這裏來了。<br>And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Your father and your brothers have come to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>47:6</a></td><td class=td>埃及地都在你麵前，隻管叫你父親和你弟兄們住在最好的地；他們可以住在歌珊地。你若知道他們中間有什麼能幹的人，就派他們看管我的牲畜。<br>The land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land; let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know any capable men among them, make them overseers over my livestock.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>47:14</a></td><td class=td>約瑟收聚了埃及地和迦南地所有的銀子，就是眾人買糧的銀子；約瑟就把那銀子帶到法老的宮裏。<br>And Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>47:15</a></td><td class=td>埃及地和迦南地的銀子都花盡了，埃及眾人都來見約瑟，說，我們的銀子都用盡了，求你給我們糧食，我們為什麼要死在你麵前呢？<br>And when the money from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan had been spent, all the Egyptians came to Joseph saying, Give us food, for why should we die in your presence? For our money is gone.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>47:16</a></td><td class=td>約瑟說，若是銀子用盡了，可以把你們的牲畜帶來，我就給你們糧食，來換你們的牲畜。<br>And Joseph said, Bring your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money is gone.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>47:17</a></td><td class=td>於是他們把牲畜趕到約瑟那裏，約瑟就拿糧食換了他們的馬、羊群、牛群和驢；那一年因換他們一切的牲畜，就用糧食養活他們。<br>And they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses and for the flocks of sheep and for the herds of cattle and for the donkeys; and he fed them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>47:18</a></td><td class=td>那一年過去，第二年他們又來見約瑟，說，我們不瞞我主，我們的銀子都花盡了，牲畜也都歸了我主。我們在我主眼前，除了我們的身體和田地之外，一無所剩。<br>And when that year had ended, they came to him the second year and said to him, We cannot hide from my lord that our money has been spent, and the herds of cattle are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord except our bodies and our lands.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>47:19</a></td><td class=td>我們為什麼要在你麵前人死地荒呢？求你用糧食買我們和我們的地，我們和我們的地就要給法老效力；並且求你給我們種子，使我們得以存活，不至死亡，地土也不至荒涼。<br>Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we and our land will become servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>47:20</a></td><td class=td>於是約瑟為法老買了埃及所有的地；埃及人因被饑荒所迫，各都賣了自己的田地；那地就都歸了法老。<br>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them; and the land became Pharaoh's.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>47:21</a></td><td class=td>至於百姓，約瑟叫他們從埃及境內的這邊直到那邊，都遷移到各城裏。<br>And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>47:22</a></td><td class=td>惟有祭司的地，約瑟沒有買，因為祭司有從法老所得的常俸。他們吃法老所給的常俸，所以他們不賣自己的地。<br>Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an assigned portion from Pharaoh, and they lived off their portion which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>47:23</a></td><td class=td>那時約瑟對百姓說，看哪，我今日為法老買了你們和你們的地；這裏有種子給你們，你們可以種地。<br>Then Joseph said to the people, Now that I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh, here is seed for you that you may sow the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>47:24</a></td><td class=td>到收割的時候，你們要把五分之一納給法老，五分之四可以歸你們自己作田地裏的種子，也作你們、你們家人和孩童的食物。<br>And when harvest comes, you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths shall be your own as seed of the field and as food for you and for those of your households and as food for your little ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>47:25</a></td><td class=td>他們說，你救了我們的性命。但願我們在我主眼前蒙恩，我們就作法老的仆人。<br>And they said, You have saved our lives. May we find favor in the sight of my lord and be Pharaoh's servants.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>47:26</a></td><td class=td>於是約瑟為埃及的地立下定例，直到今日：法老必得五分之一，惟獨祭司的地不歸法老。<br>And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt that stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>47:27</a></td><td class=td>以色列人住在埃及的歌珊地；他們在那裏置了產業，並且極其繁衍增多。<br>And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they acquired possessions in it and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>47:28</a></td><td class=td>雅各住在埃及地十七年，雅各平生的年日是一百四十七歲。<br>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. Thus the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>47:29</a></td><td class=td>以色列的死期臨近了，他就叫了他兒子約瑟來，說，我若在你眼前蒙恩，請你把手放在我大腿下起誓；用恩慈和誠信待我，請你不要將我葬在埃及。<br>And the time for Israel to die drew near. And he called his son Joseph and said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh and deal with me in kindness and truth; please do not bury me in Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>47:30</a></td><td class=td>我與我祖我父同睡的時候，你要將我帶出埃及，葬在他們所葬的地方。約瑟說，我必遵著你的話而行。<br>But when I lie down with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burial place. And he said, I will do as you have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>47:31</a></td><td class=td>雅各說，你要向我起誓。約瑟就向他起了誓，於是以色列在床頭上敬拜神。<br>And he said, Swear to me; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself at the head of his bed.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
