<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>我心裏說，來罷，我要試一試享樂，好享美福！誰知，這也是虛空。<br>I said in my heart, Come now, I will test out pleasure; so  taste enjoyment. But indeed, this also is vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>我指嬉笑說，這是狂妄；論享樂說，這有何功效呢？<br>I said of laughter, Madness! and of pleasure, What does it accomplish?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>我心裏查究，如何用酒使我肉體舒暢，我心卻仍以智慧引導我；又如何持住愚昧，等我看明，世人在天下一生有數的日子中所作的，有何好處。<br>I searched with my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine while my heart guided me with wisdom, and how to take hold of folly, until I could see what good there is for the children of men to do under the heavens the few days of their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>我為自己動大工程，建造房屋，栽種葡萄園，<br>I enlarged my works: I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>修造園囿，在其中栽種各樣果樹；<br>I made gardens and parks for myself, and planted in them trees of every kind of fruit.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>挖造水池，用以澆灌生長的林木。<br>I made water ponds for myself from which to water a forest of growing trees.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>我買了仆婢，也有生在家中的奴仆；又擁有許多的牛群羊群，勝過以前在耶路撒冷的眾人。<br>I bought male and female servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, more than all that had been before me in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>我又為自己積蓄金銀，和君王並各省的財寶；又得唱歌的男女，和世人所喜愛的物，並許多的妃嬪。<br>I gathered also silver and gold for myself and the treasures of kings and provinces; I got for myself male singers and female singers and the delights of the children of men,  concubine after concubine.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>這樣，我就日見昌大，勝過以前在耶路撒冷的眾人；我的智慧仍然存留。<br>And I became great and increased more than all who had been before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>凡我眼所要的，我沒有不給的；我不禁止我的心有任何的享樂；因我的心在我一切勞碌中得了快樂，這就是我從一切勞碌中所得的分。<br>And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I did not keep my heart from any pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in all my labor, and this was my portion from all my labor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>後來，我轉看我手所作的一切工，和我工作中的勞碌；誰知都是虛空，都是捕風；在日光之下毫無益處。<br>Then I turned to all the works that my hands had done and the labor by which I had labored in doing them, and indeed, all was vanity and a chasing after wind; and there was no advantage under the sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>我轉看智慧、狂妄和愚昧。在王以後來的人還能作什麼呢？也不過作早先所作的就是了。<br>And I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly, for what will the man do who comes after the king? Only that which has been done already.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>我便看出智慧勝過愚昧，如同光明勝過黑暗。<br>And I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>智慧人的眼目光明，愚昧人在黑暗裏行；但我也看明，這兩等人所遭遇的都是一樣。<br>The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness; yet I also perceived that one fate happens to them all.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>我就心裏說，愚昧人所遭遇的，我也必遭遇。既是這樣，我為何更有智慧呢？我心裏說，這也是虛空。<br>And I said in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so also will it happen to me. Why then have I been so wise? And I said in my heart, This also is vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>智慧人和愚昧人一樣，永遠無人記念，因為日後都要被遺忘；可歎智慧人死亡，與愚昧人無異！<br>For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance forever, seeing that in the days to come all will be forgotten. And how the wise man dies just like the fool!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>所以我恨惡生命，因為在日光之下所作的工，我都以為煩惱；一切都是虛空，都是捕風。<br>So I hated life, for the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me, because everything is vanity and a chasing after wind.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>我恨惡一切的勞碌，就是我在日光之下的勞碌，因為我所得的都必留給我以後的人。<br>And I hated all my labor for which I had labored under the sun, because I will leave it to the man who comes after me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>那人是智慧是愚昧，誰能知道？他竟要管理我勞碌所得的一切，就是我在日光之下用智慧所得的。這也是虛空。<br>And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will be master over all my labor for which I have labored and in which I exercised wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>2:20</a></td><td class=td>故此，我轉想我在日光之下勞碌所得的一切，心便絕望。<br>Therefore I turned and gave my heart up to despair of all the labor for which I had labored under the sun;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>2:21</a></td><td class=td>因為有人用智慧、知識、技能所勞碌得來的，卻要留給未曾勞碌的人為分。這也是虛空，也是大患。<br>For there is a man whose labor has been with wisdom and with knowledge and with skill, and to a man who has not labored on it he gives it as his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>2:22</a></td><td class=td>人在日光之下勞碌操心，在他一切的勞碌上得著什麼呢？<br>For what will a man have with all his labor and with the striving of his heart by which he labors under the sun?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>2:23</a></td><td class=td>因為他一生的日子都是憂傷，他的辛勞成為愁煩，連夜間心也不安息。這也是虛空。<br>For all his days are sorrow, and his travail is vexation; even at night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>2:24</a></td><td class=td>人莫強如吃喝，且讓自己在勞碌中享美福。我看這也是出於神的手。<br>There is nothing better for man than to eat and to drink and to make his soul taste enjoyment in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>2:25</a></td><td class=td>因為離了祂，誰能吃用、享受呢？<br>For who can eat or who can enjoy  without Him?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>2:26</a></td><td class=td>神看誰為好，就給誰智慧、知識和喜樂；卻將辛勞給罪人，叫他將所收聚的、所堆積的，歸給神看為好的人。這也是虛空，也是捕風。<br>For to the man who is good in His sight He gives wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner He gives the travail of gathering and heaping up that it may be given to him who is good in God's sight. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
