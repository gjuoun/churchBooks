<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>4:1</a></td><td class=td>參巴拉聽見我們建造城牆就發怒，大大惱恨，嗤笑猶大人，<br>And when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he became angry and was greatly enraged; and he mocked the Jews.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>4:2</a></td><td class=td>對他弟兄和撒瑪利亞的軍兵說，這些軟弱的猶大人作什麼呢？他們要為自己修築城牆麼？要獻祭麼？要一日完成麼？要從土堆裏拿出火燒的石頭再立牆麼？<br>And he spoke to his brothers and the army of Samaria and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore it for themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the dust heaps, though they are burned?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>4:3</a></td><td class=td>亞捫人多比雅站在旁邊，說，他們所建造的石牆，就是狐狸上去也必踩出洞來。<br>And Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, Even their stone wall that they are building, if a fox were to go up on it, he would breach it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>4:4</a></td><td class=td>我們的神阿，求你垂聽，因為我們被藐視；求你使他們的淩辱歸在他們頭上，使他們在被擄到之地成為掠物。<br>Hear, O our God, for we are despised; and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them as spoil in the land of captivity;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>4:5</a></td><td class=td>不要遮掩他們的罪孽，不要使他們的罪從你麵前塗抹，因為他們在建造的人麵前惹動你的怒氣。<br>And do not cover their iniquity and do not let their sin be blotted out before You, for they made provocations before the builders.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>4:6</a></td><td class=td>這樣，我們建造城牆，城牆就都連接起來，高至一半，因為百姓用心作工。<br>So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a heart to work.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>4:7</a></td><td class=td>參巴拉、多比雅、亞拉伯人、亞捫人、亞實突人，聽見耶路撒冷城牆修複的工作有進展，破裂的地方開始堵住，就甚發怒。<br>And when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the restoration of the walls of Jerusalem was advancing, that the breaches were beginning to be closed up, they became very angry;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>4:8</a></td><td class=td>他們同謀要來攻擊耶路撒冷，使城內擾亂。<br>And all of them conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem and cause confusion in it.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>4:10</a></td><td class=td>猶大人說，灰土尚多，扛抬的人力氣已經衰敗，所以我們不能建造城牆。<br>And Judah said, The strength of the burden bearers fails, And the debris is great; And we are not able To build the wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>4:11</a></td><td class=td>我們的敵人且說，趁他們還不知道，還看不見，我們進入他們中間殺他們，使工作止住。<br>And our adversaries said, They will not know, nor even see, until we come into their midst and slay them and cause the work to stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>4:12</a></td><td class=td>那靠近敵人居住的猶大人，十次來對我們說，他們必從你們所到的各處上來攻擊我們。<br>And when the Jews who dwelt near them came, they said to us ten times, They will come up against us from all the places that you turn to.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>4:13</a></td><td class=td>所以我使百姓各按家族，拿刀、拿槍、拿弓，站在城牆後邊低窪的空曠處。<br>So I set men in the lowest places behind the wall, on the exposed areas, and I set the people by families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>4:14</a></td><td class=td>我察看了，就起來對貴胄、官長、和其餘的百姓說，不要怕他們；當記念那大而可畏的主，要為你們的弟兄、兒女、妻子、家產爭戰。<br>And when I saw the situation, I rose up and said to the nobles and the rulers and the rest of the people, Do not be afraid of them; remember the great and awesome Lord, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your houses.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>4:15</a></td><td class=td>仇敵聽見我們知道他們的計謀，又見神破壞他們的計畫，就不來了；我們都回到城牆那裏，各作各的工。<br>And when our enemies heard that their counsel was known to us and that God frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each man to his work.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>4:16</a></td><td class=td>從那日起，我的仆人一半作工，一半拿槍、拿盾牌、拿弓、穿鎧甲；官長都站在猶大家眾人的後邊。<br>And from that day half of my servants labored in the work, and half of them held the spears and the shields and the bows and the armor; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>4:17</a></td><td class=td>建造城牆的、扛抬重物的，都佩帶兵器，一手作工，一手拿兵器。<br>Those who built the wall and those who carried burdens took the loads with one hand doing the work and with the other holding a weapon.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>4:18</a></td><td class=td>建造的人都腰間佩刀建造，吹角的人在我旁邊。<br>And as for the builders, each had his sword strapped to his side, and so they built; and he who sounded the trumpet was beside me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>4:19</a></td><td class=td>我對貴胄、官長、和其餘的百姓說，這工程浩大，我們在城牆上彼此相離甚遠；<br>And I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, each far from the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>4:20</a></td><td class=td>你們聽見角聲在那裏，就要聚集到我們那裏去。我們的神必為我們爭戰。<br>In whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, gather yourselves to us there. Our God will fight for us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>4:21</a></td><td class=td>於是，我們作工，其中一半拿槍，從天亮直到星宿出現的時候。<br>So we labored in the work; and half of them held spears from the start of dawn until the stars came out.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>4:22</a></td><td class=td>那時，我又對百姓說，各人和他的仆人當在耶路撒冷城中住宿，好在夜間護衛我們，白晝作工。<br>I also said to the people at that time, Let every man and his servant spend the nights inside Jerusalem so that they may be a guard for us by night and work by day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>4:23</a></td><td class=td>這樣，我和我的弟兄、仆人、並跟從我的護衛兵，都不脫衣服，各人右手拿著兵器。<br>So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes; each had his weapon at his right hand.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
