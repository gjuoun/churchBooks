<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>13:1</a></td><td class=td>我又看見一個獸從海中上來，有十角七頭，在十角上戴著十個冠冕，七頭上有褻瀆的名號。<br>And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and on his heads names of blasphemy. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>13:2</a></td><td class=td>我所看見的獸，形狀像豹，腳像熊的腳，口像獅子的口；那龍將自己的能力、座位和大權柄，都給了它。<br>And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>13:3</a></td><td class=td>獸的七頭中，有一頭似乎被殺至死，但那死傷卻醫好了。全地的人都希奇，就跟從那獸，<br>And one of his heads was as it were slain to death, and his death stroke was healed. And the whole earth marveled after the beast. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>13:4</a></td><td class=td>又拜那龍，因為它將權柄給了獸；也拜獸說，誰能比這獸？誰能與它爭戰？<br>And they worshipped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? And who can make war with him? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>13:5</a></td><td class=td>那龍又給它說誇大、褻瀆話的口，並給它權柄，可以任意而行四十二個月。<br>And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and authority was given to him to act for forty-two months. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>13:6</a></td><td class=td>獸就開口向神說褻瀆的話，褻瀆神的名、並祂的帳幕、以及那些住在天上的。<br>And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, which tabernacle in heaven. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>13:8</a></td><td class=td>凡住在地上，名字沒有記在從創世以來被殺之羔羊生命冊上的人，都要拜它。<br>And all those dwelling on the earth will worship him, every one whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>13:11</a></td><td class=td>我又看見另一個獸從地裏上來，有兩角如同羊羔，說話好像龍。<br>And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>13:12</a></td><td class=td>它在頭一個獸麵前，施行頭一個獸一切的權柄，並且叫地和住在地上的人，拜那死傷醫好的頭一個獸。<br>And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his sight, and he causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose death stroke was healed. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>13:13</a></td><td class=td>又行大奇事，甚至在人麵前，叫火從天降在地上。<br>And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth before men. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>13:14</a></td><td class=td>它因給它能力在獸麵前所行的奇事，就迷惑住在地上的人，吩咐住在地上的人，給那受刀傷還活著的獸作個像。<br>And he deceives those who dwell on the earth on account of the signs which he was given power to do before the beast, commanding those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast, who had the stroke of the sword and revived. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>13:15</a></td><td class=td>又有能力給它使獸像有氣息，叫獸像甚至能說話，又能使所有不拜獸像的人都被殺害。<br>And power was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast that the image of the beast might even speak and cause whoever would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>13:16</a></td><td class=td>它又叫眾人，無論大小貧富，自主的、為奴的，都在右手或額上，受一個印記。<br>And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the freemen and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>13:18</a></td><td class=td>在這裏需要有智慧。凡有悟性的，可以計算獸的數字，因為這是人的數字，它的數字是六百六十六。<br>Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred sixty-six. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
