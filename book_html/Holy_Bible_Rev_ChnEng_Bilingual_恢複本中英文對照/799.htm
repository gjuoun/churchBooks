<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>主何竟發怒，使烏雲遮蔽錫安的女子！祂將以色列的華美，從天扔在地上，在祂發怒的日子，並不記念自己的腳凳。<br>How the Lord in His anger Has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud! He has cast from heaven to earth The glory of Israel, And has not remembered His  footstool In the day of His anger.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>主吞滅雅各一切的住處，並不顧惜；祂在盛怒中拆毀了猶大女子的保障，使這保障坍倒在地；祂辱沒這國和其首領。<br>The Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob; He has not spared; He has torn down in His overflowing wrath The strongholds of the daughter of Judah. He has brought them down to the ground; He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>祂在烈怒中，把以色列的角全然砍斷。祂在仇敵麵前收回右手。祂像火焰四圍吞滅，在雅各中間焚燒。<br>He has cut off in fierce anger All the horn of Israel. He has withdrawn His right hand From before the enemy. He has burned among Jacob like a flame of fire; It consumes all around.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>祂張弓，好像仇敵；祂站著舉起右手，如同敵人，將悅人眼目的盡行殺戮。在錫安女子的帳棚上，倒出祂的忿怒像火一樣。<br>He has bent His bow like an enemy; He has set His right hand like an adversary And has slain all that was pleasant to the eye. In the tent of the daughter of Zion He has poured out His wrath like fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>主如仇敵吞滅以色列，吞滅她的一切宮殿；主毀壞她的保障，在猶大女子中，加增悲傷哀號。<br>The Lord has become like an enemy; He has swallowed up Israel; He has swallowed up all her palaces; He has destroyed her strongholds And multiplied in the daughter of Judah Mourning and lamentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>祂強力拆毀自己的帷幕，好像拆毀園子；祂毀壞自己的聚會之處；耶和華使所定的節期和安息日，在錫安都被忘記；祂在怒氣的憤恨中，藐視君王和祭司。<br>And He has violently taken away His pavilion like a garden; He has destroyed the place of His assembly; Jehovah has caused the appointed feast and the Sabbath To be forgotten in Zion; He has despised, in the indignation of His anger, The king and the priest.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>主丟棄了祂的祭壇，憎惡祂的聖所，將宮殿的牆垣交在仇敵手中。他們在耶和華的殿中喧嚷，像在所定節期之日一樣。<br>The Lord has cast off His altar; He has abhorred His sanctuary; He has delivered up into the hand of the enemy The walls of her palaces. They have made a noise in the house of Jehovah As though it were the day of an appointed feast.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>耶和華想要拆毀錫安女子的城牆；祂拉了準繩，不將手收回，定要毀滅；祂使外郭和城牆都悲哀，一同衰敗。<br>Jehovah has thought to destroy The walls of the daughter of Zion; He has stretched out the line And has not withdrawn His hand from destroying; And He has made the rampart and the wall to mourn; They languish together.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>錫安的門陷入地內；耶和華將她的門閂毀壞、折斷；她的君王和首領落在沒有律法的列國中；她的申言者也不得見耶和華的異象。<br>Her gates have sunk into the ground; He has destroyed and broken her bars; Her king and her princes are among nations Where there is no law; Her prophets also do not find A vision from Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>錫安女子的長老坐在地上，默默無聲；他們把塵土撒在頭上，腰束麻布；耶路撒冷的處女，垂頭至地。<br>The elders of the daughter of Zion Sit on the ground; they are silent. They have cast dust upon their head; They have girded themselves with sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem Hang down their head to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>我的眼流淚，以致失明；我的心腸翻騰，肝膽塗地，都因我的民遭毀滅，又因孩童和吃奶的在城內街上發昏。<br>My eyes are consumed with tears; My bowels are in ferment; My liver is poured out on the earth, Because of the brokenness of the daughter of my people, Because the little ones and the nursing children Faint in the streets of the city.</td></tr>

What shall I liken you to, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare you to, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your breach is great like a sea. Who will heal you?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>你的申言者為你看見虛幻和愚妄的異象，並沒有揭露你的罪孽，使你被擄的歸回；卻為你看見虛假的默示，和使你被趕逐的緣故。<br>Your prophets have seen for you Vanity and folly, And they have not uncovered your iniquity To turn again your captivity; But they have seen for you burdens Of vanity and of causes of  banishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>凡過路的，都向你拍掌；他們向耶路撒冷的女子嗤笑搖頭，說，難道這城就是人所稱為全美的，稱為全地所喜悅的麼？<br>All those who pass on the way Clap their hands at you; They hiss and wag their head At the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city which they called, The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?</td></tr>

This is certainly the day that we have looked for; We have found it; we have  seen it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>耶和華成就了祂所定意的，應驗了祂從古時所吩咐的話；祂傾覆了，並不顧惜，使你的仇敵因勝過你而喜樂；祂使你敵人的角被高舉。<br>Jehovah has done what He  purposed; He has fulfilled His word, Which He commanded from the days of old; He has torn down and has not spared, And He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you; He has exalted the horn of your adversaries.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>錫安民的心哀求主：錫安女子的城牆阿，願你晝夜流淚如河，不得歇息；願你眼中的瞳人，淚流不止。<br>Their heart cried out to the Lord: O wall of the daughter of Zion, Let tears run down like a stream Day and night; Give yourself no respite; Let not the pupil of your eye  cease.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>夜間每逢交更的時候，你要起來呼喊，在主麵前傾心如水；你的孩童在各街頭挨餓發昏，你要為他們的性命向主舉手禱告。<br>Arise, cry out in the night At the beginning of the watches; Pour out your heart like water Before the face of the Lord; Lift up your hands toward Him For the life of your little ones, Who faint because of famine At the head of every street.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>2:20</a></td><td class=td>耶和華阿，求你觀看，見你向誰這樣行？婦人豈可吃自己所生育，就是自己所撫弄的嬰孩麼？祭司和申言者，豈可在主的聖所中被殺戮麼？<br>See, O Jehovah, and look, With whom You have dealt  thus? Shall the women eat their fruit, The little ones nursed by them? Shall the priest and the prophet be slain In the sanctuary of the Lord?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>2:21</a></td><td class=td>少年人和老年人，都在街上躺臥；我的處女和壯丁，都倒在刀下；你在發怒的日子，殺死他們；你殺戮了，並不顧惜。<br>The youth and the old man Lie on the ground in the  streets; My virgins and my young men Have fallen by the sword; You have slain them in the day of Your anger; You have slaughtered; You have not spared.</td></tr>
