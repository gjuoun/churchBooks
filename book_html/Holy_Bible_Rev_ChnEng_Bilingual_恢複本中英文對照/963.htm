And what is this wisdom given to this man, and how is it that such works of power take place through His hands? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>6:3</a></td><td class=td>這不是那木匠麼？不是馬利亞的兒子，雅各、約西、猶大、西門的長兄麼？祂妹妹們不也是在我們這裏麼？他們就因祂絆跌。<br>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us? And they were stumbled in Him. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>6:14</a></td><td class=td>耶穌的名聲傳揚出去，希律王也聽見了。有人說，施浸者約翰從死人中複活了，所以這些異能發顯在他身上。<br>And King Herod heard of it, for His name had become known, and they said, John the baptizer has been raised from the dead, and because of this these works of power are operating through him. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>6:20</a></td><td class=td>因為希律曉得約翰是義人，是聖人，所以敬畏他，並且保護他；雖聽他講論，甚感困惑，卻仍喜歡聽他。<br>For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was very perplexed yet heard him gladly. </td></tr>

The king said to the girl, Ask of me whatever you want, and I will give it to you. </td></tr>
