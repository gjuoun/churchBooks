<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>1:3</a></td><td class=td>約拿卻起來，逃往他施去躲避耶和華的麵；他下到約帕，遇見一隻船，要往他施去。他就給了船價，下到船裏，要與船上的人同往他施去，躲避耶和華的麵。<br>But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah, and he went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare for it and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>1:4</a></td><td class=td>然而耶和華使海中刮起大風，海就風浪大作，船幾乎破壞。<br>But Jehovah hurled a great wind toward the sea, and there was a great tempest on the sea, and the ship seemed to be about to break up.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>1:5</a></td><td class=td>水手便懼怕，各人哀求自己的神。他們將船上的物件拋在海中，為要使船輕些。約拿卻已下到底艙，躺臥沉睡。<br>Then the mariners became afraid, and each called out to his god. And they cast out the equipment that was on the ship into the sea to lighten themselves of it. But Jonah had gone down into the innermost part of the vessel and lain down and fallen fast asleep.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>1:7</a></td><td class=td>船上的人彼此說，來罷，我們掣簽，好知道這災臨到我們是因誰的緣故；於是他們掣簽，掣出約拿來。<br>And each man said to his companion, Come, let us cast lots that we may know on whose account this misfortune has befallen us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.</td></tr>

For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Jehovah, because he had told them so.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>1:11</a></td><td class=td>他們問他說，我們當向你怎樣行，使海為我們平靜下來呢？這是因為海越發翻騰。<br>And they said to him, What shall we do with you that the sea may be quiet for us? For the sea grew more and more tempestuous.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>1:12</a></td><td class=td>他對他們說，你們將我抬起來，拋進海裏，海就會為你們平靜下來；我知道你們遭這大風浪，是因我的緣故。<br>Then he said to them, Lift me up and cast me into the sea, and the sea will be quiet for you. For I know that it is on my account that this great tempest has come upon you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>1:13</a></td><td class=td>然而那些人竭力搖槳，要回到旱地，卻是不能，因為海越發向他們翻騰。<br>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get back to the dry land, but they could not, because the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>1:14</a></td><td class=td>他們便呼求耶和華說，耶和華阿，我們懇求你，不要因這人的性命使我們滅亡；不要使流無辜血的罪歸與我們；因為你耶和華是照自己所喜悅的行事。<br>And they cried out to Jehovah and said, Ah, Jehovah, let us not perish, we pray, for this man's life, and do not put innocent blood upon us; for You, Jehovah, have done as You pleased.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>1:15</a></td><td class=td>他們遂將約拿抬起，拋進海裏，海的怒濤就止息了。<br>Then they lifted Jonah up and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased its raging.</td></tr>
