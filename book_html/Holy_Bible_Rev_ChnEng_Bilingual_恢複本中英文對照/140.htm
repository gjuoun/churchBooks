<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>23:2</a></td><td class=td>巴勒照巴蘭的話行了。巴勒和巴蘭在每座壇上獻一隻公牛和一隻公綿羊。<br>And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken. And Balak and Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>23:3</a></td><td class=td>巴蘭對巴勒說，你站在你的燔祭旁邊，我要往前去，或者耶和華會來迎見我；祂指示我什麼，我必告訴你。於是巴蘭上到一個光禿的高處。<br>And Balaam said to Balak, Stand near your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatever He shows me I will tell you. And he went to a bare height.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>23:4</a></td><td class=td>神迎見巴蘭；巴蘭說，我豫備了七座壇，在每座壇上獻了一隻公牛和一隻公綿羊。<br>And God met Balaam, and he said to Him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>23:5</a></td><td class=td>耶和華將話放在巴蘭口中，又說，你回到巴勒那裏，要如此如此說。<br>And Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, Return to Balak, and you shall speak this.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>23:7</a></td><td class=td>巴蘭便題起詩歌說，巴勒引我出亞蘭，摩押王引我出東方的山，說，來阿，為我咒詛雅各；來阿，怒罵以色列。<br>And he took up his parable and said, From Aram Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East. Come, curse Jacob for me; And come, denounce Israel!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>23:8</a></td><td class=td>神沒有咒詛的，我焉能咒詛？耶和華沒有怒罵的，我焉能怒罵？<br>How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?  And how can I denounce whom Jehovah has not denounced?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>23:9</a></td><td class=td>我從高峰看他，從小山望他；這是獨居的民，不將自己算在萬民中。<br>For from the top of the rocks I see him,  And from the hills I behold him. Here is a people who live alone And do not reckon themselves  among the nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>23:10</a></td><td class=td>誰能數算雅各的塵土？誰能數點以色列的四分之一？願我之死如正直人之死；願我之終如正直人之終。<br>Who can count the dust of Jacob,  Or number the fourth part of Israel?  Let me die the death of the upright, And let my latter end be like theirs!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>23:11</a></td><td class=td>巴勒對巴蘭說，你向我作的是什麼事？我領你來咒詛我的仇敵，不料，你竟完全為他們祝福。<br>And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, but now you have altogether blessed  them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>23:12</a></td><td class=td>他回答說，耶和華放在我口中的話，我能不謹慎講說麼？<br>And he answered and said, Shall I not take care to speak what Jehovah puts in my mouth?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>23:13</a></td><td class=td>巴勒說，求你同我往另一處去，你從那裏可以看見他們；你不能看見他們全部，隻能看見他們營的邊緣。你要從那裏為我咒詛他們。<br>And Balak said to him, Come now with me to another place from which you may see them. You will see only the outside edge of them and not see them all; then curse them for me from there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>23:14</a></td><td class=td>於是巴勒領巴蘭到瑣腓田，上毗斯迦山頂，築了七座壇；每座壇上獻一隻公牛和一隻公綿羊。<br>So he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>23:16</a></td><td class=td>耶和華迎見巴蘭，將話放在他口中，又說，你回到巴勒那裏，要如此如此說。<br>And Jehovah met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, Return to Balak, and you shall speak this.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>23:17</a></td><td class=td>他就回到巴勒那裏，見他站在燔祭旁邊；摩押的首領也和他在一起。巴勒問巴蘭說，耶和華說了什麼話？<br>When he came to him, there he was, standing beside his burnt offering, and the rulers of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What has Jehovah spoken?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>23:18</a></td><td class=td>巴蘭便題起詩歌說，巴勒阿，你起來聽；西撥的兒子阿，你向我側耳。<br>And he took up his parable and said, Arise, O Balak, and hear;  Listen to me, O son of Zippor:</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>23:19</a></td><td class=td>神並非人，必不至說謊，也非人子，必不至後悔。祂說話，豈能不作成？祂發言，豈能不立定？<br>God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not establish it?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>23:20</a></td><td class=td>我奉命祝福；神既已賜福，這事我不能翻轉。<br>Now I have received a word to bless; Since He has blessed, then I cannot reverse it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>23:21</a></td><td class=td>祂未見雅各中有罪孽，也未見以色列中有禍患；耶和華他們的神與他們同在，有向王歡呼的聲音在他們中間。<br>He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, Nor has He seen trouble in Israel; Jehovah their God is with them, And the shout of a king is among them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>23:22</a></td><td class=td>神領他們出埃及；他們似乎有野牛之力。<br>God is the One who brought them forth out of Egypt, He has as it were the horns of the wild ox.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>23:23</a></td><td class=td>斷沒有法術可以害雅各，也沒有占卜可以害以色列。現在人論到雅各，論到以色列，必說，神行了何等的事！<br>Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, Nor is there any divination against Israel. Now it shall be said of Jacob And of Israel, What has God wrought!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>23:24</a></td><td class=td>看哪，這民起來仿佛母獅，挺身好像公獅；未吃野食，未喝被殺者之血，絕不躺臥。<br>See, a people rises up like a lioness, And like a lion they lift themselves up. They shall not lie down until they eat the prey  And drink the blood of the slain.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>23:25</a></td><td class=td>巴勒對巴蘭說，那麼你一點不要咒詛他們，也一點不要為他們祝福。<br>And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>23:26</a></td><td class=td>巴蘭回答說，我豈不曾告訴你說，凡耶和華所說的，我必須遵行麼？　<br>But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell you, saying, All that Jehovah speaks, that I must do?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>23:27</a></td><td class=td>巴勒對巴蘭說，來罷，我領你往另一處去；或者神喜歡你從那裏為我咒詛他們。<br>And Balak said to Balaam, Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>23:28</a></td><td class=td>巴勒就領巴蘭到那下望曠野的毗珥山頂上。<br>And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which looks down upon the desert.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>23:30</a></td><td class=td>巴勒就照巴蘭的話行，在每座壇上獻一隻公牛和一隻公綿羊。<br>And Balak did just as Balaam had said, and he offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
