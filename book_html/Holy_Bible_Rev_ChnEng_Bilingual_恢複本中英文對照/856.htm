<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>6:2</a></td><td class=td>又在他們以上立總長三人，(但以理為其中之一，)使這些總督向他們三人呈報，免得王受虧損。<br>And over them, three chief ministers-of whom Daniel was one-so that these satraps might give account to them and the king might not suffer loss.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>6:3</a></td><td class=td>因這但以理有美好的靈，所以顯然超乎其餘的總長和總督，王又想立他治理通國。<br>Then this Daniel distinguished himself among the chief ministers and satraps because in him there was an excellent spirit, and the king considered setting him over the whole kingdom.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>6:4</a></td><td class=td>那時總長和總督，在國事上尋找但以理的把柄，為要告他，隻是找不著他的把柄和過失；因他忠信可靠，在他身上找不到任何疏忽和過失。<br>Then the chief ministers and satraps sought to find a ground for accusation against Daniel from the perspective of the kingdom, but they could find no ground for accusation or fault, inasmuch as he was faithful, and no negligence or fault was found related to him.</td></tr>
