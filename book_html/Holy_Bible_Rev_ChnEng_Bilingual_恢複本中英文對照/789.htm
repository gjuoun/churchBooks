<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>44:3</a></td><td class=td>這是因他們所行的惡惹我發怒，去燒香事奉別神，就是他們和你們，並你們列祖所不認識的神，。<br>Because of their wickedness which they did to provoke Me to anger, in that they went to burn incense to serve other gods, which they did not know, neither they, you, nor your fathers.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>44:18</a></td><td class=td>自從我們停止向天後燒香、澆奠祭，我們倒缺乏一切，又因刀劍、饑荒滅絕。<br>But since we ceased burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by sword and by famine.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>44:22</a></td><td class=td>耶和華因你們所作的惡，所行可憎的事，不能再容忍；所以你們的地成為荒涼、驚駭、咒詛，無人居住，正如今日一樣。<br>And Jehovah was no longer able to bear it because of the evil of your deeds, because of the abominations which you committed; therefore your land has become a desolation and an astonishment and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>44:23</a></td><td class=td>你們燒香，得罪耶和華，沒有聽從耶和華的話，沒有遵行祂的律法、條例、法度；所以你們遭遇這災禍，正如今日一樣。<br>Because you burned incense and because you sinned against Jehovah and did not listen to the voice of Jehovah or walk in His law or in His statutes or in His testimonies, therefore this evil has happened to you, as it is this day.</td></tr>
