<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>24:4</a></td><td class=td>此後，約阿施心中有意重修耶和華的殿，<br>Now after this it came up in Joash's heart to restore the house of Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>24:5</a></td><td class=td>便招聚眾祭司和利未人，對他們說，你們要往猶大各城去，向以色列眾人收集捐銀，每年可以修理你們神的殿；你們要急速辦理這事。隻是利未人不急速辦理。<br>And he gathered the priests and Levites and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and collect from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year; and you shall do the matter quickly. But the Levites did not act quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>24:6</a></td><td class=td>於是王召了祭司長耶何耶大來，對他說，從前耶和華的仆人摩西，為見證的帳幕向以色列會眾所規定的捐項，你為何不要求利未人，從猶大和耶路撒冷帶來作修理殿的費用呢？<br>So the king called for Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, Why have you not required of the Levites to bring from Judah and from Jerusalem the tax levied by Moses the servant of Jehovah on the congregation of Israel for the Tent of Testimony?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>24:7</a></td><td class=td>因為那惡婦亞他利雅的眾子曾拆毀神的殿，甚至用耶和華殿中所有分別為聖的物供奉諸巴力。<br>For the sons of the wicked Athaliah had broken up the house of God and even used the holy things of the house of Jehovah for the Baals.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>24:8</a></td><td class=td>於是王下令，眾人作了一個櫃子，放在耶和華殿的門外。<br>And the king gave orders, and they made a chest and put it outside, by the gate of the house of Jehovah.</td></tr>

They did so daily, and they collected a large amount of money.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>24:12</a></td><td class=td>王與耶何耶大將銀子交給作耶和華殿裏辦事的人，他們就雇了石匠、木匠，重修耶和華的殿；又雇了鐵匠、銅匠，修理耶和華的殿。<br>And the king and Jehoiada would give it to those who did the work of service of the house of Jehovah, and they would hire stone hewers and carpenters to restore the house of Jehovah, and also to the workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of Jehova</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>24:13</a></td><td class=td>工人操作，修複的工作在他們手中不斷進行；他們將神的殿修造得與先前一樣，而且甚是堅固。<br>And those who did the work worked, and the restoration work progressed in their hands; and they restored the house of God to its proper proportions and strengthened it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>24:14</a></td><td class=td>工程完了，他們就把餘下的銀子拿到王與耶何耶大麵前，用以製造耶和華殿事奉和獻祭所用的器皿，以及調羹和金銀的器皿。耶何耶大在世的一切日子，眾人常在耶和華殿裏獻燔祭。<br>And when they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada and made with it vessels for the house of Jehovah, vessels for service and for offering up burnt offerings, and cups and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered up burnt offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>24:15</a></td><td class=td>耶何耶大年紀老邁，日子滿足而死；死的時候年一百三十歲。<br>And when Jehoiada became old and full of days, he died; and he was one hundred thirty years old when he died.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>24:16</a></td><td class=td>人將他葬在大衛城，與諸王在一起，因為他在以色列人中行善，對神和神的殿也作了美善的事。<br>And they buried him in the city of David with the kings, because he had done well in Israel and with God and His house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>24:17</a></td><td class=td>耶何耶大死後，猶大的眾首領來朝拜王；王就聽從他們。<br>And after the death of Jehoiada the captains of Judah came and bowed down to the king; then the king listened to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>24:18</a></td><td class=td>他們離棄耶和華他們列祖之神的殿，去事奉亞舍拉和偶像；因他們這罪過，就有忿怒臨到猶大和耶路撒冷。<br>And they forsook the house of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and they served the Asherahs and the idols; so wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>24:19</a></td><td class=td>但神仍遣申言者到他們那裏，引導他們歸向耶和華；這些申言者向他們作見證，他們卻不肯聽。<br>And He sent prophets to them to bring them back to Jehovah; and they testified to them, but they did not pay attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>24:20</a></td><td class=td>那時，神的靈披戴在祭司耶何耶大的兒子撒迦利亞身上，他就站在民以上，對他們說，神如此說，你們為何幹犯耶和華的誡命，以致不得亨通呢？因為你們離棄耶和華，所以祂也離棄你們。<br>Then the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people and said to them, Thus says God, Why do you transgress the commandments of Jehovah, so that you do not prosper? For you have forsaken Jehovah, and He has forsaken you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>24:21</a></td><td class=td>眾民同謀要害撒迦利亞，就照王的吩咐，在耶和華殿的院內用石頭打死他。<br>So they conspired against him, and at the command of the king they stoned him to death in the court of the house of Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>24:22</a></td><td class=td>這樣，約阿施王不想念撒迦利亞的父親耶何耶大向自己所施的恩慈，殺了他的兒子；撒迦利亞臨死的時候說，願耶和華鑒察伸冤！<br>Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had shown him, and he slew his son; and when he died he said, May Jehovah see and avenge!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>24:23</a></td><td class=td>次年歲首，亞蘭人的軍兵上來攻擊約阿施，來到猶大和耶路撒冷，從民中殺了他們的眾首領，將所掠的一切財貨送到大馬色王那裏。<br>And at the turn of the year the army of the Syrians came up against him and came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the leaders of the people from among the people and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>24:24</a></td><td class=td>亞蘭人的軍兵雖然隻來了一小隊，耶和華卻將大隊的軍兵交在他們手裏，是因猶大人離棄耶和華他們列祖的神，所以藉亞蘭人向約阿施執行懲罰。<br>Although the army of the Syrians had come with a small number of men, Jehovah delivered into their hand a very great army, because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers. Thus they executed judgment on Joash.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>24:25</a></td><td class=td>亞蘭人離開了約阿施，離去時，他正患重病；他的臣仆同謀背叛他，要報祭司耶何耶大兒子流血之仇；他們把他殺在床上，他就死了，人將他葬在大衛城，隻是不葬在諸王的墳墓裏。<br>And when they went from him-for they left him in great sickness-his servants conspired against him because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed; and he died, and they buried him in the city of David. However they did not bury him among the tombs of the kings.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>24:26</a></td><td class=td>同謀背叛他的是亞捫婦人示米押的兒子撒拔，和摩押婦人示米利的兒子約薩拔。<br>Now those who conspired against him were Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>24:27</a></td><td class=td>至於他的眾子和許多警戒他的諭言，並他重新建立神殿的事，都寫在諸王記的評傳上。他兒子亞瑪謝接續他作王。<br>And concerning his sons and the many oracles against him and his laying the foundations of the house of Jehovah, indeed these things are written in the record of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his place.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
