<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>31:1</a></td><td class=td>第十一年三月初一日，耶和華的話臨到我，說，<br>And in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>31:2</a></td><td class=td>人子阿，你要向埃及王法老和他的眾民說，論你的偉大，誰能與你相比呢？<br>Son of man, say to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to his multitude: Whom are you like in your greatness?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>31:3</a></td><td class=td>亞述曾是利巴嫩中的香柏樹，枝條榮美，影密如林，極其高大，樹梢立於茂密枝葉中。<br>Indeed Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon With beautiful branches and forest shade And great height, And its top shoots were among the thick boughs.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>31:4</a></td><td class=td>眾水使它長大，深處的泉水使它長高；所栽之地有江河圍流，汊出的水道延到田野諸樹。<br>Waters nourished it, The deep springs made it grow; Its rivers flowed around The place it was planted; And it flowed out its channels To all the trees of the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>31:5</a></td><td class=td>所以它高大超過田野諸樹；發旺的時候，因得眾水供應，所以枝子繁多，枝條長長。<br>Therefore its height was exalted Above all the trees of the field, And its boughs were multiplied, And its branches lengthened, Because of abundant waters, as it spread.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>31:6</a></td><td class=td>空中的飛鳥都在枝子上搭窩，田野的走獸都在枝條下生子，所有大國的人民都在它蔭下居住。<br>All the birds of the sky Made their nests in its boughs, And all the beasts of the field Bore their young under its  branches, And in its shade All great nations dwelt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>31:7</a></td><td class=td>樹大枝長，成為榮美，因為根在眾水之旁。<br>Thus it was beautiful in its greatness, In the length of its branches; For its roots were beside abundant waters.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>31:8</a></td><td class=td>神園中的香柏樹不能遮蔽它；鬆樹比不上它的枝子，楓樹也不及它的枝條；神園中的樹沒有一棵能比得上它的美麗。<br>Cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; Cypresses could not compare to its boughs, And plane trees could not equal its branches; No tree in the garden of God could compare to it in its beauty.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>31:9</a></td><td class=td>我使它的枝條繁多，成為榮美，以致在神的園中，伊甸的樹都嫉妒它。<br>I made it beautiful By the multitude of its branches, So that all the trees of Eden, Which were in the garden of God, envied it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>31:10</a></td><td class=td>所以主耶和華如此說，因它樹身高大，樹梢立於茂密枝葉中，心高氣傲，<br>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because you are exalted in height-it set its top shoots among the thick boughs, and its heart is lifted up in its height -</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>31:12</a></td><td class=td>外人，就是列邦中最凶殘的，將它砍斷棄於山上，它的枝條落在一切山穀中，它的枝子折斷，落在地的一切深穀旁；地上的眾民已經離開它的蔭下，丟棄了它。<br>And strangers, the most ruthless of the nations, have cut it down and left it on the mountains, and its branches have fallen into all the valleys, and its boughs lie broken by all the ravines of the land; and all the peoples of the earth have abandoned its shade and left it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>31:13</a></td><td class=td>空中的飛鳥都要宿在這傾倒的樹上，田野的走獸都要來到它的枝條上，<br>Upon its fallen trunk All the birds of the sky will dwell, And upon its branches All the beasts of the field will be.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>31:14</a></td><td class=td>好使水旁的諸樹不因高大而自高，也不將樹梢立於茂密枝葉中，並且那些得水滋潤的樹木，都不得高大自立；因為它們都被交與死亡，到地的深處，到那些下坑的世人中去了。<br>This is so that none of the well-  \caps0watered trees will exalt themselves in their height by setting their top shoots among the thick boughs, and none of the well- watered trees will stand next to them in their height; for all of them have been delivered to death, to the lowest parts of the earth among the children of men who descend into the pit.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>31:15</a></td><td class=td>主耶和華如此說，它下陰間的那日，我便使人悲哀；我為它遮蓋深處的泉源，使江河受阻，大水停流；我也使利巴嫩為它悲傷，田野的諸樹都因它發昏。<br>Thus says the Lord Jehovah, On the day it descended to Sheol I caused a mourning; I covered the deep springs for it, and I restrained its rivers, and the great waters were shut up. I also made Lebanon mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted on account of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>31:16</a></td><td class=td>我將它扔到陰間，與下坑的人一同下去；那時，列國聽見它墜落的響聲就都震動。伊甸的一切樹，就是利巴嫩得水滋潤、最佳最美的樹，都在地的最低下之處受了安慰。<br>I made the nations quake at the sound of its fall when I cast it down to Sheol with those who descend into the pit. And all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all who drink water, were comforted in the lowest parts of the earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>31:17</a></td><td class=td>它們也與它同下陰間，到被刀殺的人那裏；它們曾作它的膀臂，在列國中居住在它的蔭下。<br>They also descended with it into Sheol to those who were slain by the sword; indeed to those who were its arm, who dwelt under its shade among the nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>31:18</a></td><td class=td>論榮耀和偉大，在伊甸的諸樹中，誰能與你相比呢？然而你要與伊甸的諸樹一同下到地的最低下之處，在未受割禮的人中，與被刀殺的人一同躺臥。法老和他的群眾乃是如此；這是主耶和華說的。<br>Which among the trees of Eden then are you like in glory and in greatness? Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lowest parts of the earth; you will lie among the uncircumcised, with those who were slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord Jehovah.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
