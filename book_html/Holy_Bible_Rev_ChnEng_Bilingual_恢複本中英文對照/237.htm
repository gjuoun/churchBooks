<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>1:2</a></td><td class=td>他有兩個妻子，一個名叫哈拿，一個名叫毗尼拿。毗尼拿有孩子，哈拿卻沒有孩子。<br>And he had two wives; the name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other was Peninnah. Now Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>1:3</a></td><td class=td>這人每年從本城上示羅去敬拜，並獻祭給萬軍之耶和華；在那裏有以利的兩個兒子何弗尼、非尼哈，作耶和華的祭司。<br>And this man went up from his city year by year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests of Jehovah, were there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>1:4</a></td><td class=td>以利加拿在獻祭的那一天，將幾分祭肉給他的妻子毗尼拿和毗尼拿所生的眾兒女；<br>And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>1:5</a></td><td class=td>但他給哈拿的分卻是雙倍的，因為他愛哈拿。無奈耶和華使哈拿不能生育。<br>But he would give a double portion to Hannah, for it was Hannah whom he loved; but Jehovah had shut up her womb.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>1:7</a></td><td class=td>年年都是如此；她上到耶和華殿的時候，毗尼拿總是這樣激動她，以致她哭泣不吃飯。<br>And so it happened year after year; when she went up to the house of Jehovah, the other provoked her this way; and she wept and would not eat.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>1:8</a></td><td class=td>她丈夫以利加拿對她說，哈拿，你為什麼哭泣，不吃飯？為什麼心裏難過？你有我不比有十個兒子還好麼？<br>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why are you weeping, and why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>1:9</a></td><td class=td>他們在示羅吃喝完了，哈拿就起來。祭司以利在耶和華殿的門框旁邊，坐在自己的位上。<br>Then after the eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah rose up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat at the doorpost of the temple of Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>1:10</a></td><td class=td>哈拿魂裏愁苦，就向耶和華禱告，痛痛哭泣；<br>And she was bitter in soul and prayed to Jehovah and wept much.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>1:13</a></td><td class=td>原來哈拿心中訴說，隻動嘴唇，聽不見聲音，因此以利以為她喝醉了。<br>And Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought that she was drunk.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>1:14</a></td><td class=td>以利對她說，你要醉到幾時呢？除去你的酒罷。<br>And Eli said to her, How long will you be drunk? Put away your wine from you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>1:15</a></td><td class=td>哈拿回答說，我主阿，不是這樣。我是靈裏受壓的婦人，淡酒濃酒都沒有喝，但在耶和華麵前傾心吐意。<br>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord. I am a woman oppressed in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>1:16</a></td><td class=td>不要將婢女看作卑劣的女子。我因被人激動，愁苦太重，所以一直訴說到如今。<br>Do not take your female servant for a worthless woman; for out of the greatness of my anxiety and provocation I have been speaking all this time.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>1:17</a></td><td class=td>以利回答說，你平平安安的去罷，願以色列的神將你向祂所求的賜給你。<br>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have requested from Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>1:18</a></td><td class=td>哈拿說，願婢女在你眼前蒙恩。於是婦人回去，並且吃飯，麵上不再帶愁容了。<br>And she said, Let your servant find favor in your sight. And the woman went her way; and she ate, and her countenance was  sad no more.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>1:19</a></td><td class=td>次日，他們清早起來，在耶和華麵前敬拜，就回拉瑪，到了家裏。以利加拿和妻子哈拿同房；耶和華記念哈拿。<br>And they rose up early in the morning and worshipped before Jehovah; and they returned and came to their house in Ramah.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>1:22</a></td><td class=td>哈拿卻沒有上去；她對丈夫說，等孩子斷了奶，我便帶他上去，讓他朝見耶和華，並且永遠住在那裏。<br>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, When the child is weaned, then I will bring him up, so that he may appear before Jehovah and stay there forever.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>1:23</a></td><td class=td>她丈夫以利加拿對她說，你看怎樣好，就怎樣行罷；可以留在家裏，等到你給孩子斷了奶。但願耶和華使祂的話堅立。於是婦人留在家裏乳養兒子，直到給他斷了奶。<br>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what is good in your sight; stay until you have weaned him. Only, may Jehovah establish His word. So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she weaned him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>1:24</a></td><td class=td>她既給孩子斷了奶，就帶他一同上去，又帶了三隻公牛，一伊法細麵，一皮袋酒；孩子還小，她就帶他到示羅耶和華的殿中。<br>And as soon as she weaned him, she brought him up with her, along with three bulls and one ephah of flour and a skin of wine; and she brought him to the house of Jehovah in Shiloh, although the child was young.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>1:25</a></td><td class=td>他們宰了一隻公牛，就領孩子到以利那裏。<br>And they slaughtered the bull and brought the child to Eli.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>1:27</a></td><td class=td>我禱告為要得這孩子；耶和華已將我向祂所求的賜給我了。<br>It was for this child that I prayed, and Jehovah has granted me my request that I requested from Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>1:28</a></td><td class=td>所以，我也將這孩子借與耶和華；他終身都是借與耶和華的。於是他們在那裏敬拜耶和華。<br>Therefore I, for my part, have lent him to Jehovah; all the days that he lives, he is lent to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
