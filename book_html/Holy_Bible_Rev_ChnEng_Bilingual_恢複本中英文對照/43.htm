<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>43:4</a></td><td class=td>你若願意打發我們的弟弟與我們同去，我們就下去給你買糧食；<br>If you are willing to send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you grain for food;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>43:5</a></td><td class=td>你若不願意打發他去，我們就不下去，因為那人對我們說，你們的弟弟若不與你們同來，你們就不得見我的麵。<br>But if you are not willing to send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>43:6</a></td><td class=td>以色列說，你們為什麼這樣害我，告訴那人你們還有弟弟呢？<br>And Israel said, Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>43:7</a></td><td class=td>他們說，那人詳細的問到我們和我們的親屬，說，你們的父親還健在麼？你們還有兄弟麼？我們就按著他所問的告訴他。我們怎能知道他會說，把你們的弟弟帶下來呢？<br>And they said, The man asked very carefully about us and about our relatives, saying, Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother? So we told him about these things. Could we possibly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>43:8</a></td><td class=td>猶大又對他父親以色列說，你打發少年人與我同去，我們就起身下去，好叫我們和你，並我們的婦人孩子，都得存活，不至於死。<br>And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the boy with me, and we will rise up and go, that we may live and not die, we and you and our little ones.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>43:12</a></td><td class=td>又要手裏帶著加倍的銀子，並要將歸還在你們袋口的銀子帶回去；那或者是錯了。<br>And take double the silver in your hand, and carry back in your hand the silver that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was a mistake.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>43:13</a></td><td class=td>也帶著你們的弟弟，起身回去見那人。<br>Take your brother also, and rise up. Return to the man,</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>43:16</a></td><td class=td>約瑟見便雅憫和他們同來，就對家宰說，將這些人領到屋裏，要宰殺牲畜，豫備筵席，因為正午這些人要同我吃飯。<br>And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to him who was over his house, Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal, and prepare it; for the men will eat with me at noon.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>43:17</a></td><td class=td>家宰就遵著約瑟的命去行，領他們進約瑟的屋裏。<br>And the man did as Joseph said, and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>43:18</a></td><td class=td>他們因為被領到約瑟的屋裏，就害怕，說，必是因為頭次歸還在我們袋子裏的銀子，才領我們到這裏來，要找機會下手害我們，強取我們作奴仆，搶奪我們的驢。<br>And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, It is because of the silver that was returned in our sacks the first time, that we are being brought in, that he may come out against us and fall upon us and take us as slaves with our donkeys.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>43:19</a></td><td class=td>他們就挨近約瑟的家宰，在屋門口和他說話，<br>And they came near to the man who was over Joseph's house and spoke to him at the door of the house,</td></tr>

So we have brought it back in our hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>43:22</a></td><td class=td>我們手裏還另外帶下銀子來買糧食。我們不知道先前誰把銀子放在我們的袋子裏。<br>And we have also brought down extra silver in our hand to buy grain for food. We do not know who put our silver in our sacks.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>43:23</a></td><td class=td>家宰說，你們可以放心，不要害怕，是你們的神和你們父親的神，賜給你們財寶在你們的袋子裏；你們的銀子，我早已收了。他就把西緬帶出來，交給他們。<br>And he said, Be at peace; do not fear. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; your silver came to me. Then he brought Simeon out to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>43:24</a></td><td class=td>家宰就領他們進約瑟的屋裏，給他們水洗腳，又給他們飼糧喂驢。<br>And the man brought the men into Joseph's house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys fodder.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>43:25</a></td><td class=td>他們就豫備禮物，等候約瑟正午來，因為他們聽見要在那裏吃飯。<br>And they prepared the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they had heard that they would eat a meal there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>43:26</a></td><td class=td>約瑟來到家裏，他們就把手中的禮物拿進屋去給他，又俯伏在地，向他下拜。<br>And when Joseph came into the house, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed down to the ground to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>43:27</a></td><td class=td>約瑟問他們安，又說，你們的父親，就是你們所說的那老人家平安麼？他還健在麼？<br>And he asked them about their welfare and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>43:28</a></td><td class=td>他們回答說，你仆人我們的父親平安；他還健在。於是他們低頭下拜。<br>And they said, Your servant our father is well; he is still alive. And they bowed and paid him homage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>43:29</a></td><td class=td>約瑟舉目看見他同母的弟弟便雅憫，就說，你們向我所說那最小的弟弟，就是這位麼？又說，小兒阿，願神賜恩給你。<br>And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>43:30</a></td><td class=td>約瑟愛弟之情發動，就急忙尋找可哭之處，進入自己的內室，哭了一場。<br>And Joseph hurried-for his inward parts burned for his brother-and sought a place to weep. So he entered into his chamber and wept there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>43:31</a></td><td class=td>他洗了臉出來，勉強忍住，吩咐人擺飯。<br>Then he washed his face and came out, and he controlled himself and said, Serve the meal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>43:32</a></td><td class=td>他們就為約瑟單擺了一席，為那些人又擺了一席，也為和約瑟同吃飯的埃及人另擺了一席，因為埃及人不可和希伯來人一同吃飯；那原是埃及人所厭惡的。<br>And they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat a meal with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>43:33</a></td><td class=td>約瑟使眾弟兄在他麵前坐席，都按著長幼的次序，眾弟兄就彼此驚奇相看。<br>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, and the men looked at one another in astonishment.</td></tr>
