<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>6:1</a></td><td class=td>這樣，我們可說什麼？我們可以仍留在罪中，叫恩典增多麼？<br>What then shall we say? Should we continue in sin that grace may abound? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>6:2</a></td><td class=td>絕對不可！我們這向罪死了的人，豈可仍在罪中活著？<br>Absolutely not! We who have died to sin, how shall we still live in it? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>6:3</a></td><td class=td>豈不知我們這浸入基督耶穌的人，是浸入祂的死麼？<br>Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>6:4</a></td><td class=td>所以我們藉著浸入死，和祂一同埋葬，好叫我們在生命的新樣中生活行動，像基督藉著父的榮耀，從死人中複活一樣。<br>We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>6:5</a></td><td class=td>我們若在祂死的樣式裏與祂聯合生長，也必要在祂複活的樣式裏與祂聯合生長；<br>For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>6:6</a></td><td class=td>知道我們的舊人已經與祂同釘十字架，使罪的身體失效，叫我們不再作罪的奴仆，<br>Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>6:7</a></td><td class=td>因為已死的人，是已經從罪開釋了。<br>For he who has died is justified from sin. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>6:8</a></td><td class=td>我們若與基督同死，就信也必與祂同活，<br>Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>6:9</a></td><td class=td>知道基督既從死人中複活，就不再死，死也不再作主管轄祂了。<br>Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more; death lords it over Him no more. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>6:10</a></td><td class=td>因為祂死，是一次永遠的向罪死了；祂活，是向神活著。<br>For the death which He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life which He lives, He lives to God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>6:11</a></td><td class=td>這樣，你們在基督耶穌裏，向罪也當算自己是死的，向神卻當算自己是活的。<br>So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>6:12</a></td><td class=td>所以不要讓罪在你們必死的身體裏作王，使你們順從身體的私欲，<br>Do not let sin therefore reign in your mortal body so that you obey the body's lusts; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>6:13</a></td><td class=td>也不要將你們的肢體獻給罪作不義的兵器；倒要像從死人中活過來的人，將自己獻給神，並將你們的肢體獻給神作義的兵器。<br>Neither present your members as weapons of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and your members as weapons of righteousness to God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>6:14</a></td><td class=td>罪必不能作主管轄你們，因你們不在律法之下，乃在恩典之下。<br>For sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>6:15</a></td><td class=td>這卻怎麼樣？因我們不在律法之下，乃在恩典之下，就可以犯罪麼？絕對不可！<br>What then? Should we sin, because we are not under the law but under grace? Absolutely not! </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>6:16</a></td><td class=td>豈不曉得你們將自己獻給誰作奴仆，以至於順從，就作了你們所順從者的奴仆麼？或作罪的奴仆，以至於死，或作順從的奴仆，以至於義。<br>Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as slaves for obedience, his slaves you are whom you obey, whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>6:17</a></td><td class=td>感謝神，你們從前雖然作罪的奴仆，現今卻從心裏順從了你們被交於其中之教訓的規模。<br>But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which you were delivered. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>6:18</a></td><td class=td>你們既從罪裏得了釋放，就作了義的奴仆。<br>And having been freed from sin, you were enslaved to righteousness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>6:19</a></td><td class=td>我因你們肉體的軟弱，就照著人的常情說，你們從前怎樣將肢體獻給不潔不法作奴仆，以至於不法，現今也要照樣將肢體獻給義作奴仆，以至於聖別。<br>I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>6:20</a></td><td class=td>因為你們作罪之奴仆的時候，就不受義的約束。<br>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>6:21</a></td><td class=td>那時你們有什麼果子？不過是你們現今所看為羞恥的事，那些事的結局就是死。<br>What fruit then did you have at that time? Things of which you are now ashamed, for the end of those things is death. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>6:22</a></td><td class=td>但現今你們既從罪裏得了釋放，作了神的奴仆，就有聖別的果子，結局就是永遠的生命。<br>But now, having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>6:23</a></td><td class=td>因為罪的工價乃是死，惟有神的恩賜，在我們的主基督耶穌裏，乃是永遠的生命。<br>For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
