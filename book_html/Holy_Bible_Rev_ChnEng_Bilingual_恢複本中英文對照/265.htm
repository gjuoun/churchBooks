<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>29:1</a></td><td class=td>非利士人將他們所有的軍旅聚集到亞弗；以色列人在耶斯列的泉旁安營。<br>And the Philistines gathered all their camps together at Aphek; and Israel encamped by the spring that is in Jezreel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>29:2</a></td><td class=td>非利士人的首領各率軍隊，或百或千，挨次往前走過去；大衛和跟隨他的人同著亞吉，在後邊跟著往前走過去。<br>And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands; and David and his men passed on at the rear with Achish.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>29:3</a></td><td class=td>非利士人的首領說，這些希伯來人在這裏作什麼？亞吉對非利士人的首領說，這不是以色列王掃羅的臣仆大衛麼？他在我這裏有些年日了。自從他投降我直到今日，我在他身上未曾見到什麼過錯。<br>And the princes of the Philistines said, What are these Hebrews  doing here? And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, Is this not David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or  even these years? And I have found nothing  wrong in him since the day he deserted  to me to this day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>29:4</a></td><td class=td>非利士人的首領向亞吉發怒，對他說，你要叫這人回去，使他回到你所安置他的地方，不可叫他和我們一同下到戰陣，恐怕他在陣上成了我們的對頭。這人要用什麼與他主人和好呢？豈不是用我們這些人的首級麼？<br>But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him. And the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make the man go back, that he may return to his place that you have assigned him, so that he does not go down with us into the battle and does not become our adversary in the battle. For with what might this man reconcile himself to his master? Will it not be with the heads of these men?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>29:5</a></td><td class=td>從前以色列的婦女跳舞唱和說，掃羅殺死千千，大衛殺死萬萬，所說的不是這個大衛麼？<br>Is this not David, of whom they sang to one another in dances, saying, Saul has struck down his thousands; But David, his ten thousands?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>29:6</a></td><td class=td>亞吉叫大衛來，對他說，我指著永活的耶和華起誓，你是正直人。你隨我在軍中出入，我看你甚好。自從你來我這裏，直到今日，我在你身上未曾見到什麼惡事；隻是眾首領不喜悅你。<br>And Achish called David and said to him,  As Jehovah lives, you are upright, and it is acceptable in my sight that you go forth and come in with me in the camp; for I have not found evil in you since the day you came to me to this day. But you are not acceptable to the lords.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>29:7</a></td><td class=td>現在你可以平平安安的回去，免得你作非利士人首領不喜歡的事。<br>Now therefore return and go in peace, so that you do not do anything displeasing to the lords of the Philistines.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>29:8</a></td><td class=td>大衛對亞吉說，我作了什麼？自從我到你麵前的那一天，直到今日，你在仆人身上見到什麼過錯，使我不去攻打我主我王的仇敵呢？<br>And David said to Achish, But what have I done? And what  wrong have you found in your servant since the day I began to be with you to this day, that I should not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>29:9</a></td><td class=td>亞吉回答大衛說，我知道你在我眼前是好人，如同神的使者一般；隻是非利士人的首領說，這人不可同我們上陣。<br>And Achish answered and said to David, I know that you are as acceptable to me as an angel of God; nevertheless the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us into the battle.</td></tr>

And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
