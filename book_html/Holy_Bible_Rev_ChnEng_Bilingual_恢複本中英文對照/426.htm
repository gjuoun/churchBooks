<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>13:1</a></td><td class=td>當日，人念摩西的律法書給百姓聽，遇見書上寫著說，亞捫人或摩押人永不可入神的會，<br>On that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and it was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should enter the assembly of God forever,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>13:2</a></td><td class=td>因為他們沒有拿食物和水來迎接以色列人，反而雇了巴蘭咒詛他們，但我們的神使那咒詛變為祝福。<br>For they did not meet the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them; yet our God turned the curse into a blessing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>13:3</a></td><td class=td>眾民聽見這律法，就使一切閑雜人與以色列人分開。<br>And when they heard the law, they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>13:4</a></td><td class=td>這事以前，蒙派管理我們神殿中屋子的祭司以利亞實，因與多比雅結親，<br>Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who had been appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, because he was related to Tobiah,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>13:5</a></td><td class=td>為他豫備了一間大屋子，那是從前存放素祭、乳香、器皿，以及照命令供給利未人、歌唱的、守門的，五穀、新酒、和新油的十分之一，並歸祭司之舉祭的地方。<br>Had prepared for him a large chamber where previously they had put the meal offering, the frankincense, and the vessels, as well as the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the fresh oil, as commanded for the Levites and the singers and the gatekeepers, and the heave offerings for the priests.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>13:6</a></td><td class=td>這一切發生時我不在耶路撒冷，因為巴比倫王亞達薛西三十二年，我到王那裏去；過了一段日子，我向王告假。<br>But during all this time I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king of Babylon I went to the king; then after some time I asked leave from the king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>13:7</a></td><td class=td>我來到耶路撒冷，就知道以利亞實為多比雅在神殿的院內豫備屋子的這件惡事。<br>And I came to Jerusalem and perceived the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>13:8</a></td><td class=td>我甚惱怒，就把多比雅的一切用器都從屋子裏拋出去，<br>And it grieved me much; therefore I cast all the household utensils of Tobiah out of the chamber.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>13:10</a></td><td class=td>我見利未人所當得的分無人供給他們，甚至供職的利未人與歌唱的，俱各奔回自己的田地去了。<br>I also found out that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them and thus the Levites and the singers, who performed the service, had gone back, each to his own fields.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>13:11</a></td><td class=td>我就斥責官長說，為何離棄神的殿呢？我便招聚利未人，使他們重站原來的崗位。<br>So I contended with the rulers and said, Why has the house of God been forsaken? Then I gathered them together and set them in their stations.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>13:12</a></td><td class=td>猶大眾人就把五穀、新酒、和新油的十分之一，送入倉庫。<br>And all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the fresh oil to the storehouses.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>13:13</a></td><td class=td>我派祭司示利米雅、經學家撒督、和利未人毗大雅，作庫官管理倉庫；副官是瑪他尼的孫子，撒刻的兒子哈難。這些人都算是忠信的，他們的職分是將所供給的分給他們的弟兄。<br>And I appointed treasurers over the storehouses, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and it was their charge to distribute to their brothers.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>13:15</a></td><td class=td>那些日子，我在猶大見有人在安息日踹酒醡，搬運禾捆馱在驢上，又把酒、葡萄、無花果、和各樣的擔子，在安息日運進耶路撒冷；我就在他們賣食物的那日警戒他們。<br>In those days I saw some in Judah treading wine presses on the Sabbath and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on their donkeys, as well as wine, grapes and figs, and every kind of load, and they were bringing them into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; and I protested on the day that they sold food.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>13:17</a></td><td class=td>我就斥責猶大的貴胄，對他們說，你們怎麼行這惡事瀆犯安息日呢？<br>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah and said to them, What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>13:18</a></td><td class=td>從前你們列祖豈不是這樣行，以致我們的神使這一切災禍臨到我們和這城麼？現在你們還瀆犯安息日，使神的忿怒越發臨到以色列。<br>Did not your fathers act this way, and did not our God bring all this trouble upon us and upon this city? But you bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>13:19</a></td><td class=td>在安息日以前，耶路撒冷城門日落有黑影的時候，我就吩咐人將門關鎖，並且吩咐人不準開放，直到安息日過了；我又派我幾個仆人在城門站崗，免得有人在安息日擔什麼擔子進來。<br>And when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors be shut and commanded that they not be opened until after the Sabbath; and I set some of my servants at the gates so that no load could enter on the Sabbath day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>13:20</a></td><td class=td>於是商人和販賣各樣貨物的，有一兩次在耶路撒冷城外過夜。<br>Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>13:21</a></td><td class=td>我就警戒他們，說，你們為何在城牆前麵過夜？若再這樣，我必下手拿辦你們。從此以後，他們在安息日就不來了。<br>But I testified against them and said to them, Why do you spend the night in front of the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>13:22</a></td><td class=td>我吩咐利未人當潔淨自己，並來守城門，使安息日分別為聖。我的神阿，求你也因這事記念我，照你的大慈愛憐惜我。<br>And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and that they should come and keep the gates, in order to sanctify the Sabbath day. For this also remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>13:23</a></td><td class=td>那些日子，我也見猶大人娶了亞實突、亞捫、摩押的女子為妻。<br>In those days I also saw that the Jews had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>13:24</a></td><td class=td>他們的兒女說話，一半是亞實突的話，不會說猶大的話，所說的是照著各民的方言。<br>And as for their children, half spoke in the language of Ashdod; and none of them could speak the language of Judah, but they spoke the language of the respective peoples.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>13:25</a></td><td class=td>我就斥責他們，咒詛他們，打了他們幾個人，拔下他們的頭發，叫他們指著神起誓，我說，你們不可將自己的女兒嫁給他們的兒子，也不可為自己的兒子和自己娶他們的女兒。<br>And I contended with them and cursed them and struck some of them and pulled out their hair; and I made them swear by God, saying, You shall not give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>13:26</a></td><td class=td>我又說，以色列王所羅門不是在這些事上犯罪麼？在多國中並沒有一王像他，且蒙他神所愛，神使他作全以色列的王；然而連他也被外邦女子引誘犯罪。<br>Did not Solomon the king of Israel sin in these matters? And among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel; yet the foreign wives caused even him to sin.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>13:27</a></td><td class=td>難道我們要聽從你們，行這一切大惡，娶外邦女子為妻，行事不忠信得罪我們的神麼？<br>Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil by acting unfaithfully against our God in marrying foreign women?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>13:28</a></td><td class=td>大祭司以利亞實的孫子，耶何耶大的一個兒子，是和倫人參巴拉的女婿，我就從我這裏把他趕出去。<br>And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliashib the high priest was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, so I chased him away from me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>13:29</a></td><td class=td>我的神阿，求你記念他們的罪；因為他們玷汙了祭司的職任，並玷汙了有關祭司職任及利未人的約。<br>Remember them, O my God; for they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>13:30</a></td><td class=td>這樣，我潔淨他們，使他們離絕一切外邦的事物。我派定祭司和利未人的職守，使他們各盡其職。<br>Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign. And I appointed duties for the priests and the Levites, each in his work,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>13:31</a></td><td class=td>我又派百姓按定期獻木柴和初熟之物。我的神阿，求你記念我，以善待我。<br>And for the wood offering, at the appointed times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
