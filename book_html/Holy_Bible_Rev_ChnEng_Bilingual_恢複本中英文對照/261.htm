<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>25:3</a></td><td class=td>那人名叫拿八；他的妻子名叫亞比該，是個有見識、形貌美麗的婦人。拿八為人剛愎，行事凶惡；他是迦勒族的人。<br>And the man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigail. And the woman had good discernment and was beautiful in appearance. But the man was hard, and he was evil in  his doings; and he was a Calebite.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>25:8</a></td><td class=td>可以問你的少年人，他們必告訴你。所以願這些少年人在你眼前蒙恩，因為我們是在好日子來的。求你將手上所有的，無論是什麼，賜一點給你的仆人們，和你兒子大衛。<br>Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let these young men find favor in your sight, for we come in a good time. Give whatever you may have on hand to your servants and to your son David.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>25:15</a></td><td class=td>但是那些人待我們甚好；我們在田野與他們來往的時候，沒有被他們侮辱，也未曾失落什麼。<br>But the men were very good to us; and we were not harmed, nor did we miss anything all the time we went with them when we were in the fields.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>25:16</a></td><td class=td>我們在他們那裏牧羊的一切日子，他們晝夜作我們的保障。<br>They were a wall to us both by night and by day all the time we were with them tending the sheep.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>25:17</a></td><td class=td>所以你當明白，看怎樣行才好，因為禍患必定臨到我主人和他全家。他是個卑劣之徒，無人敢與他說話。<br>Now therefore know and consider what you will do, because evil has been determined against our master and against all his house; for he is so worthless a man that no one can speak to him.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>25:21</a></td><td class=td>大衛曾說，我在曠野為這人看守所有的，以致他一樣不失落，實在是徒然了；因他向我以惡報善。<br>Now David had said, It was certainly in vain that I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that he has; for he has repaid me evil for good.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>25:22</a></td><td class=td>凡屬拿八的男丁，我若留一個到明日早晨，願神重重的降罰與我。<br>May God do so to David's enemies, and even more, if I leave so much as a male child of all that he has until morning.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>25:23</a></td><td class=td>亞比該見大衛，便急忙下驢，在大衛麵前臉伏於地叩拜，<br>And when Abigail saw David, she hurried and got down from her donkey and fell on her face before David; and she bowed herself to the ground.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>25:25</a></td><td class=td>我主不要把這卑劣之人拿八放在心上，他的名字怎樣，為人也怎樣；他名叫拿八，他為人果然愚頑。但我主所打發的少年人，婢女並沒有看見。<br>May my lord not take this worthless man Nabal to heart. For as his name is, so he is: Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I your female servant did not see my lord's young men, whom you sent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>25:26</a></td><td class=td>我主阿，耶和華既然阻止你流人的血，阻止你親手報仇，所以我指著永活的耶和華起誓，並指著你的性命起誓，說，願你的仇敵和謀害我主的人，都像拿八一樣。<br>And now, my lord, as Jehovah lives and as your soul lives, since Jehovah has withheld you from entering into bloodshed and from avenging yourself by your own hand, now therefore let your enemies and those who seek harm against my lord be like Nabal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>25:27</a></td><td class=td>如今求你將婢女給我主送來的這禮物，給跟隨我主的少年人。<br>And now this present which your servant has brought to my lord, let  it be given to the young men who follow my lord.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>25:28</a></td><td class=td>求你饒恕婢女的罪過；耶和華必為我主建立穩固的家，因我主為耶和華爭戰；並且在你平生的日子，你身上查不出有什麼惡來。<br>Please forgive the transgression of your female servant, for Jehovah will no doubt make a sure house for my lord, because my lord fights the battles of Jehoah; and no evil will be found in you throughout your days.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>25:29</a></td><td class=td>雖有人起來追逼你，尋索你的性命，我主的性命卻在耶和華你的神那裏，包裹在生命的囊中；你仇敵的性命，耶和華必拋去，如從機弦甩出去一樣。<br>And though men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, my lord's life will be bound up in the bundle of the living with Jehovah your God; and the lives of your enemies He will sling out, as from the hollow of the sling.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>25:30</a></td><td class=td>到了耶和華照祂論到你所說的一切好處待我主，立你作以色列的領袖時，<br>And when Jehovah has done to my lord according to all the good He has spoken concerning you and has appointed you ruler over Israel,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>25:31</a></td><td class=td>我主必不至因曾無故流人的血，為自己報仇，而良心有虧，心中不安。耶和華善待我主的時候，求你記念婢女。<br>This will not be a qualm of conscience to you or a stumbling block in heart to my lord, that you shed blood without cause or that my lord has avenged himself. And when Jehovah has dealt well with my lord, may you remember your female servant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>25:32</a></td><td class=td>大衛對亞比該說，耶和華以色列的神是當受頌讚的，因為祂今日打發你來迎接我。<br>And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>25:33</a></td><td class=td>你的見識當受稱讚；你也當受稱讚，因為你今日攔阻我流人的血，親手報仇。<br>And blessed be your discretion; and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from entering into bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>25:34</a></td><td class=td>那阻止我加害你之永活的耶和華以色列的神，我指著祂確切的起誓，你若沒有速速的來迎接我，到明日早晨，凡屬拿八的男丁必定不留一個。<br>For surely as Jehovah the God of Israel lives, who has withheld me from harming you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, indeed there would not have been left to Nabal  even a male child until morning's light.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>25:35</a></td><td class=td>大衛從亞比該手中受了她送來的禮物，就對她說，你平平安安的上你家去罷，看哪，我聽了你的話，準了你的情麵。<br>So David took from her hand what she brought to him. And he said to her, Go up in peace to your house. See, I have listened to your voice and have accepted your person.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>25:36</a></td><td class=td>亞比該到拿八那裏，見他在家裏設擺筵席，如同王的筵席。拿八心中暢快，大大的醉了；亞比該無論大小事都沒有告訴他，直等到次日早晨。<br>And Abigail went to Nabal.
