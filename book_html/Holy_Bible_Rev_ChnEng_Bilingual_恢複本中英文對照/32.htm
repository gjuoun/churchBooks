<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>32:1</a></td><td class=td>雅各仍舊行路，神的眾使者遇見他。<br>And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>32:2</a></td><td class=td>雅各看見他們就說，這是神的軍營，於是給那地方起名叫瑪哈念。<br>And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's camp. So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>32:3</a></td><td class=td>雅各打發報信的人先往西珥地，以東鄉間，見他哥哥以掃；<br>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, into the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>32:4</a></td><td class=td>他吩咐他們說，你們要對我主以掃這樣說：你的仆人雅各這樣說，我在拉班那裏寄居，直留到如今。<br>And he commanded them, saying, Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>32:5</a></td><td class=td>我有牛、驢、羊群、仆人、婢女，現在打發人來報告我主，為要在你眼前蒙恩。<br>And I have oxen and donkeys and flocks, and male servants and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord this, that I may find favor in your sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>32:6</a></td><td class=td>報信的人回到雅各那裏，說，我們到了你哥哥以掃那裏，他正迎著你來，同他一起的有四百人。<br>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and he also is coming to meet you; and four hundred men are with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>32:7</a></td><td class=td>雅各就甚懼怕，而且愁煩，便把那與他同在的人口和羊群、牛群、駱駝分作兩隊，<br>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two camps;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>32:8</a></td><td class=td>說，以掃若來擊殺這一隊，剩下的那一隊還可以逃避。<br>And he said, If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp which is left will escape.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>32:9</a></td><td class=td>雅各說，耶和華我祖亞伯拉罕的神，我父親以撒的神阿，你曾對我說，回你本地，到你親族那裏去，我要善待你。<br>Then Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who said to me, Return to your country and to your relatives, and I will do you good,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>32:10</a></td><td class=td>你向仆人所施的一切慈愛和信實，我一點也不配得；我先前隻拿著我的杖過這約但河，如今我卻成了兩隊。<br>I am not worthy of all the lovingkindnesses and of all the faithfulness which You have shown to Your servant, for with my staff only I crossed over this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>32:11</a></td><td class=td>求你救我脫離我哥哥以掃的手；因為我怕他來擊殺我，連妻子帶兒女一同擊殺了。<br>Deliver me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and attack me, even the mother with the children.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>32:12</a></td><td class=td>你曾說，我必定善待你，使你的後裔如同海沙，多得不可勝數。<br>But You have said, I will surely do you good and make your seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>32:13</a></td><td class=td>當夜，雅各在那裏住宿，就從他所有的物中拿禮物要送給他哥哥以掃：<br>And he spent that night there. Then from what he had with him he took a present for Esau his brother:</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>32:14</a></td><td class=td>母山羊二百隻，公山羊二十隻，母綿羊二百隻，公綿羊二十隻，<br>Two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>32:16</a></td><td class=td>每樣各分一群，交在仆人手下，就對仆人說，你們要在我前頭過去，使一群一群之間有個距離；<br>And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, Cross over before me, and put a space between each drove.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>32:17</a></td><td class=td>又吩咐盡先走的說，我哥哥以掃遇見你的時候，問你說，你是那家的人？要往那裏去？你前頭這些牲畜是誰的？<br>And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, To whom do you belong? And where are you going? And whose animals are these before you?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>32:18</a></td><td class=td>你就說，是你仆人雅各的，是送給我主以掃的禮物；他自己也在我們後邊。<br>Then you will say, Your servant Jacob's; it is a present sent to my lord Esau; and now he also is behind us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>32:19</a></td><td class=td>又吩咐第二、第三、和一切趕群畜的人說，你們遇見以掃的時候，也要這樣對他說；<br>And he commanded also the second and the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, In this way you shall speak to Esau when you find him,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>32:20</a></td><td class=td>並且你們要說，你仆人雅各就在我們後邊。因為雅各心裏說，我藉著在我前頭去的禮物解他的恨，然後再見他的麵，或者他會接納我。<br>And you shall also say, Your servant Jacob is right behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>32:21</a></td><td class=td>於是禮物在他前頭過去了；那夜，他在隊中住宿。<br>So the present crossed over before him, and he himself spent that night in the camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>32:22</a></td><td class=td>他夜間起來，帶著兩個妻子，兩個使女，並十一個兒子，過雅博渡口。<br>And he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two female servants and his eleven children and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>32:23</a></td><td class=td>他帶著他們，打發他們過河，又打發所有的都過去。<br>And he took them and sent them over the stream and sent over what he had.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>32:24</a></td><td class=td>隻剩下雅各一人，有一個人和他摔跤，直到黎明。<br>And Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>32:25</a></td><td class=td>那人見自己勝不過他，就將他的大腿窩摸了一把；雅各正與那人摔跤的時候，他的大腿窩就脫了節。<br>And when the man saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob's hip was dislocated as he wrestled with Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>32:26</a></td><td class=td>那人說，天快亮了，讓我去罷。雅各卻說，你若不給我祝福，我就不讓你去。<br>And the man said, Let Me go, for the dawn is breaking. But Jacob said, I will not let You go unless You bless me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>32:27</a></td><td class=td>那人對他說，你名叫什麼？他說，我名叫雅各。<br>And He said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>32:28</a></td><td class=td>那人說，你的名不要再叫雅各，要叫以色列；因為你與神與人較力，都得了勝。<br>And He said, Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>32:29</a></td><td class=td>雅各問祂說，請將你的名告訴我。但那人說，你何必問我的名？於是祂在那裏給雅各祝福。<br>And Jacob asked Him and said, Please tell me Your name. But He said, Why is it that you ask My name? And He blessed him there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>32:30</a></td><td class=td>雅各便給那地方起名叫毗努伊勒，因為他說，我麵對麵看見了神，我的性命仍得保全。<br>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, for, he said, I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been preserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>32:31</a></td><td class=td>日頭升起，照在雅各身上，那時他渡過毗努伊勒，他的大腿就瘸了。<br>And the sun rose upon him as he crossed over Penuel, and he limped because of his hip.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>32:32</a></td><td class=td>故此，以色列人不吃大腿窩的筋，直到今日，因為那人摸了雅各大腿窩的筋。<br>Therefore the children of Israel do not eat the thigh muscle, which is upon the socket of the hip, to this day, because He touched the socket of Jacob's hip at the thigh muscle.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
