<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>49:1</a></td><td class=td>論亞捫人：耶和華如此說，以色列沒有兒子麼？沒有後嗣麼？瑪勒堪為何得迦得之地為業呢？屬他的民為何住迦得的城邑呢？<br>Concerning the children of Ammon: Thus says Jehovah, Does Israel have no sons? Or has he no heir? Why has Malcam possessed Gad, And why do his people dwell in his cities?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>49:2</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，因此日子將到，我必使人聽見打仗的呐喊，是攻擊亞捫人拉巴的呐喊。拉巴要成為亂堆；其鄉村要被火焚燒；先前趕出以色列的，這時以色列要趕出他們；這是耶和華說的。<br>Therefore indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, When I will cause the alarm of war to be heard Against Rabbah of the children of Ammon. And it will become a mound of desolation, And its villages will be burned with fire. And Israel will dispossess those who dispossess him, Says Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>49:3</a></td><td class=td>希實本哪，你要哀號，因為艾城已被毀滅；拉巴的女子阿，要呼喊。要以麻布束腰，要哭號，在圍籬內跑來跑去；因瑪勒堪和屬他的祭司、首領，要一同被遷徙。<br>Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai has been destroyed; Cry out, O daughters of Rabbah. Gird yourselves with sackcloth and  wail, And run to and fro among the enclosures; For Malcam will go into exile, Together with his priests and his princes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>49:4</a></td><td class=td>背道的女子阿，你倚靠自己的財寶，說，誰會來攻擊我呢？你為何誇耀自己的山穀呢？你的山穀必如水流失。<br>Why do you boast in your valleys? Your valley is flowing away, O apostate daughter, Who trusts in her treasures, saying, Who will come against me?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>49:5</a></td><td class=td>主萬軍之耶和華說，我要使恐嚇從四圍的眾人中臨到你們；你們必被趕出，各往各方，沒有人收聚逃民。<br>I will bring dread upon you, Declares the Lord Jehovah of hosts, From all around you; And each one will be driven out headlong, And no one will gather him who flees.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>49:6</a></td><td class=td>但後來我要使被擄的亞捫人歸回；這是耶和華說的。<br>But afterward I will turn again The captivity of the children of Ammon, Declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>49:7</a></td><td class=td>論以東：萬軍之耶和華如此說，提幔中再沒有智慧麼？聰明人不再有謀略麼？他們的智慧耗盡了麼？<br>Concerning Edom: Thus says Jehovah of hosts, Is there no more wisdom in  Teman? Has counsel perished from those who understand? Is their wisdom spent?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>49:8</a></td><td class=td>底但的居民哪，要轉身逃跑，住在隱密處；因為我向以掃追討的時候，必使災禍臨到他。<br>Flee, turn back, dwell in hidden places, O inhabitants of Dedan, For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him At the time I visit him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>49:9</a></td><td class=td>摘葡萄的若來到你這裏，豈不剩下些葡萄麼？盜賊若夜間來，豈不是隻毀壞到彀了麼？<br>If the grape gatherers came to you, Would they not leave gleanings? If thieves came by night, Would they not destroy only  enough for themselves?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>49:10</a></td><td class=td>我卻剝光以掃，顯出他的隱密處；他不能掩藏自己。他的後裔、弟兄、鄰舍，盡都毀滅，他也歸於無有。<br>But I have stripped Esau bare; I have exposed his secret places, And he is not able to conceal himself. His seed and his brothers are destroyed, And his neighbors and he are no more.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>49:11</a></td><td class=td>你撇下孤兒，我必使他們存活；你的寡婦可以信靠我。<br>Leave your orphans behind; I will preserve them alive, And let your widows trust in Me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>49:12</a></td><td class=td>耶和華如此說，原來判定不該喝那杯的，一定要喝。你能盡免刑罰麼？你不能免罰，一定要喝。<br>For thus says Jehovah, Those whose judgment was not to drink the cup will certainly drink it. And will you by any means be left unpunished? You will not be left unpunished, for you will certainly drink it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>49:13</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，我指著自己起誓，波斯拉必成為荒廢、羞辱、咒詛，並且荒涼；她的一切城邑，必成為永遠的荒場。<br>For I have sworn by Myself, declares Jehovah, that Bozrah will become a waste, a reproach, a ruin and a curse; and all her cities will become eternal desolations.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>49:14</a></td><td class=td>我從耶和華那裏聽見信息，並有使者被差往列國去，說，你們聚集來攻擊以東，起來爭戰。<br>I have heard a report from Jehovah, And an envoy is sent among the nations, saying, Gather yourselves together, and come against her, And arise for war.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>49:15</a></td><td class=td>因為我使你在列國中為最小，在人中間被藐視。<br>For, indeed, I have made you small among the nations, Despised among men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>49:16</a></td><td class=td>住在磐石穴中，據守高岡的阿，你的威嚇，你心中的狂傲，欺騙了你。你雖如鷹高高搭窩，我必從那裏拉下你來；這是耶和華說的。<br>Your terribleness, the pride of your heart, Has beguiled you, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, Who grasp the height of the hill. Though you make your nest as high as an eagle's, I will bring you down from there, declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>49:17</a></td><td class=td>以東必令人驚駭；凡經過的人都必驚駭，又嗤笑她一切的創傷。<br>And Edom will become an astonishment; everyone who passes by her will be astonished and will hiss at all her wounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>49:18</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，必無人住在那裏，也無世人在其中寄居，就像所多瑪、蛾摩拉、和鄰近的城邑傾覆一樣。<br>As when Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown with its neighbors, says Jehovah, no one will dwell there, nor will a son of man sojourn in her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>49:19</a></td><td class=td>看哪，必有一人像獅子從約但河邊的叢林上來，攻擊堅固的居所；轉眼之間，我要使以東人逃跑離開她；誰蒙揀選，我就派誰治理她。誰能像我呢？誰能給我定規日期呢？誰是那能在我麵前站立的牧人呢？<br>Indeed, one will come up like a lion from the majesty of the Jordan against a secure habitation, for I will suddenly make them run away from her; and whoever is chosen I will appoint over her. For who is like Me? And who can appoint Me a time? And who is that shepherd who can stand before Me?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>49:20</a></td><td class=td>所以你們要聽耶和華攻擊以東所設的謀略，和祂攻擊提幔居民所定的意念：仇敵定要將他們羊群中微小的拉去；祂定要使他們的居所荒涼。<br>Therefore hear the counsel of Jehovah, which He purposed against Edom, and His thoughts, which He has thought against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they will drag them off, the little ones of the flock; surely He will make their habitation a desolation because of them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>49:21</a></td><td class=td>因他們仆倒的聲音，地就震動。人在紅海那裏，聽見了呼喊的聲音。<br>The earth quaked at the sound of their fall. There is a cry; the sound of it has been heard in the Red Sea.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>49:22</a></td><td class=td>祂必如大鷹飛起撲下，展開翅膀攻擊波斯拉；到那日，以東勇士的心必疼痛，如臨產婦人的心一樣。<br>Indeed, He will mount up and swoop down like an eagle, and spread out His wings over Bozrah; and the heart of the mighty men of Edom in that day will be like the heart of a woman in labor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>49:23</a></td><td class=td>論大馬色：哈馬和亞珥拔蒙羞，因為他們聽見凶惡的消息。他們的心融化；海上有憂慮，不得平靜。<br>Concerning Damascus: Hamath and Arpad are put to shame Because they have heard an evil report. They melt; anxiety is on the sea; It cannot be quiet.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>49:24</a></td><td class=td>大馬色發軟，轉身逃跑；恐慌將她捉住，痛苦憂愁將她抓住，如正在生產的婦人一樣。<br>Damascus has become feeble; She has turned to flee, And\caps0  panic has taken hold of her; Pain and anguish seize her, Like a woman giving birth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>49:25</a></td><td class=td>我所稱讚的城、所喜樂的鎮，為何沒有被撇棄呢？<br>How the city of praise is not  forsaken, The town of My joy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>49:26</a></td><td class=td>因此，她的少年人必仆倒在街上；當那日，一切兵丁必默默無聲；這是萬軍之耶和華說的。<br>Therefore her young men will fall in her open squares, And all the men of war will be silenced in that day, declares Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>49:27</a></td><td class=td>我必在大馬色城牆使火著起，燒滅便哈達的宮殿。<br>And I will set fire to the wall of Damascus, And it will consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>49:28</a></td><td class=td>論巴比倫王尼布甲尼撒所攻打的基達，和夏瑣的諸國：耶和華如此說，起來，上基達去，毀滅東方人。<br>Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon struck down: Thus says Jehovah: Arise, go up against Kedar, And destroy the children of the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>49:29</a></td><td class=td>他們的帳棚和羊群，都要奪去；要將幔子和一切器皿並駱駝，為自己掠去；他們要彼此喊著說，四圍都有驚嚇！<br>And they will take away their tents and their flocks; Their curtains and all their vessels And their camels they will carry away for themselves, And they will call out to one another, Terror is on every side!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>49:30</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，夏瑣的居民哪，要逃奔遠方，住在隱密處；因為巴比倫王尼布甲尼撒設計謀害你們，定策略攻擊你們。<br>Flee, wander far away, dwell in hidden places, O inhabitants of Hazor, declares Jehovah; For Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon Has taken counsel against you And has devised a plan against you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>49:31</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，起來，上安居無慮的國那裏去；他們是無門無閂，獨自居住的。<br>Arise, go up against a nation without care, One that dwells securely, declares Jehovah. It has no gates and bars; They dwell alone.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>49:32</a></td><td class=td>他們的駱駝必成為掠物，他們眾多的牲畜必成為擄物；我必將剃周圍胡須的人分散各方，使災禍從四圍臨到他們；這是耶和華說的。<br>And their camels will become  plunder, And the multitude of their livestock spoil; And I will scatter those who cut the corners of their beards into every wind, And I will bring their calamity from every side of them, Declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>49:33</a></td><td class=td>夏瑣必成為野狗的住處，永遠荒涼；必無人住在那裏，也無世人在其中寄居。<br>And Hazor will become a habitation of jackals, An eternal desolation; No one will dwell there; Neither will a son of man sojourn in it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>49:34</a></td><td class=td>猶大王西底家登基的時候，耶和華論以攔的話臨到申言者耶利米，說，<br>The word of Jehovah which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the king of Judah, saying,</td></tr>
