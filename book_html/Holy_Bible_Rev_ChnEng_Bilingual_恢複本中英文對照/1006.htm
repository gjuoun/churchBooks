<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>9:16</a></td><td class=td>法利賽人中有的說，這個人不是從神來的，因為祂不守安息日。又有的說，一個罪人怎能行這樣的神跡？他們中間就起了分裂。<br>Then some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>9:21</a></td><td class=td>至於他如今怎麼看見了，我們卻不知道，是誰開了他的眼睛，我們也不知道；你們問他吧，他已經成人，會替自己說話了。<br>But how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age; he will speak for himself. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>9:22</a></td><td class=td>他父母說這話，是因怕猶太人，因為猶太人已經商議定了，若有承認耶穌是基督的，要把他趕出會堂。<br>His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him to be the Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>9:23</a></td><td class=td>因此他父母說，他已經成人了，你們問他吧。<br>Because of this his parents said, He is of age; question him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>9:24</a></td><td class=td>所以法利賽人第二次叫了那從前瞎眼的人來，對他說，你當將榮耀歸與神，我們知道這人是個罪人。<br>Therefore a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>9:25</a></td><td class=td>那人回答說，祂是個罪人不是，我不知道；有一件事我知道，從前我是瞎眼的，現在看見了。<br>Then he answered, Whether or not He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>9:26</a></td><td class=td>他們就問他說，祂向你作了什麼？是怎麼開了你的眼睛？<br>They said then to him, What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes? </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>9:39</a></td><td class=td>耶穌說，我為審判到這世上來，叫看不見的可以看見，看得見的反瞎了眼。<br>And Jesus said, For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=40>9:40</a></td><td class=td>同祂在那裏的法利賽人，有的聽見這話，就說，難道我們也瞎了眼麼？<br>Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, We are not blind also, are we? </td></tr>
