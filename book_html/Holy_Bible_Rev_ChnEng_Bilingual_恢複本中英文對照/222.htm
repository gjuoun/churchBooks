<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>11:2</a></td><td class=td>基列的妻子也給他生了幾個兒子；他妻子所生的兒子長大了，就趕逐耶弗他，說，你不可在我們父家承受產業，因為你是別的婦人的兒子。<br>And Gilead's wife bore him sons. And when the woman's sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, You shall not have an inheritance in the house of our father, for you are the son of some other woman.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>11:3</a></td><td class=td>耶弗他就逃離他的弟兄們，去住在陀伯地。有些無賴之徒到他那裏聚集，與他一同出入。<br>So Jephthah fled from his brothers and dwelt in the land of Tob. And worthless men collected around Jephthah, and they went out with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>11:4</a></td><td class=td>過了些日子，亞捫人與以色列爭戰。<br>And after some time the children of Ammon fought with Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>11:5</a></td><td class=td>亞捫人與以色列爭戰的時候，基列的長老到陀伯地去，要叫耶弗他回來。<br>And when the children of Ammon fought with Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>11:6</a></td><td class=td>他們對耶弗他說，請你來作我們的統帥，我們好與亞捫人爭戰。<br>And they said to Jephthah, Come and be our chief, and we will fight against the children of Ammon.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>11:7</a></td><td class=td>耶弗他對基列的長老說，從前你們不是恨我、趕逐我離開父家麼？現在你們遭難為何到我這裏來呢？<br>And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Are you not the ones who hated me and drove me out from the house of my father? Why then do you come to me now that you are in distress?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>11:8</a></td><td class=td>基列的長老對耶弗他說，現在我們回到你這裏來，是因為要你同我們去，攻打亞捫人；你可以作我們基列一切居民的首領。<br>And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, This is the reason we have turned now to you, that you would come with us and fight against the children of Ammon and be for us the head of all the inhabitants of Gilead.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>11:13</a></td><td class=td>亞捫人的王對耶弗他的使者說，因為以色列人從埃及上來的時候奪了我的地，從亞嫩河到雅博河，直到約但河。現在你要和和平平的將這地歸還。<br>And the king of the children of Ammon said to Jephthah's messengers, Because Israel took my land when they came up from Egypt, from the Arnon as far as Jabbok and the Jordan.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>11:15</a></td><td class=td>對他說，耶弗他如此說，以色列人並沒有奪取摩押地和亞捫人的地。<br>And he said to him, Thus says Jephthah, Israel did not take the land of Moab nor the land of the children of Ammon.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>11:16</a></td><td class=td>以色列人從埃及上來時，乃是經過曠野到紅海，來到加低斯，<br>But when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>11:17</a></td><td class=td>就打發使者去見以東王，說，求你讓我們從你的地經過。以東王卻不應允。他們又打發使者去見摩押王，他也不允準。因此以色列人就住在加低斯。<br>Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, May we please pass through your land? But the king of Edom would not hear of it. And they also sent messengers to the king of Moab, but he would not allow it. So Israel remained in Kadesh.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>11:18</a></td><td class=td>他們又經過曠野，繞著以東地和摩押地，到了摩押地的東邊，在亞嫩河的另一邊安營；因此他們並沒有入摩押的境內，因為亞嫩河是摩押的邊界。<br>And they went through the wilderness and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab; and they went to the east of the land of Moab and encamped beyond the Arnon. Thus they did not go through the territory of Moab, for the Arnon is the border of Moab.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>11:19</a></td><td class=td>然後以色列人打發使者去見亞摩利人的王西宏，就是希實本的王，對他說，求你讓我們從你的地經過，往我們自己的地方去。<br>Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon the king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, May we please pass through your land to our place?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>11:20</a></td><td class=td>西宏卻不信任以色列人，不讓他們經過他的境界。西宏招聚他的眾民在雅雜安營，與以色列人爭戰。<br>But Sihon did not trust Israel to cross through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people together and encamped in Jahaz; and he fought with Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>11:21</a></td><td class=td>耶和華以色列的神，將西宏和他的眾民都交在以色列人手中，以色列人就擊殺他們，得了住在那地之亞摩利人的全地。<br>And Jehovah the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them. And Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>11:22</a></td><td class=td>他們得了亞摩利人的四境，從亞嫩河到雅博河，從曠野直到約但河。<br>And they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon as far as Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>11:23</a></td><td class=td>如今耶和華以色列的神，既為祂百姓以色列的緣故趕出亞摩利人，你竟要得他們的地麼？<br>So now Jehovah the God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites for the sake of His people Israel. Should you then dispossess them?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>11:24</a></td><td class=td>你的神基抹為你所趕出之人的地，你不是要得為業麼？耶和華我們的神為我們的緣故所趕出之人的一切地，我們就要得為業。<br>Will you not take possession of that which Chemosh your god has dispossessed for you? Thus we will take possession of all that Jehovah our God dispossesses for our sake.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>11:25</a></td><td class=td>難道你比摩押王西撥的兒子巴勒還強麼？他曾與以色列人爭競，或曾與他們爭戰麼？<br>And now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab? Did he ever strive with Israel, or did he ever fight against them?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>11:26</a></td><td class=td>以色列人住希實本和屬希實本的鄉鎮，亞羅珥和屬亞羅珥的鄉鎮，並沿亞嫩河的一切城邑，已經有三百年了；在這三百年之內，你們為什麼沒有取回這些地方呢？<br>While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along the Arnon, three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>11:27</a></td><td class=td>原來我沒有得罪你，你卻攻打我，惡待我。願審判人的耶和華今日在以色列人和亞捫人中間審斷。<br>So I have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong in fighting against me. Jehovah the Judge will judge today between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>11:28</a></td><td class=td>亞捫人的王不肯聽耶弗他打發人對他所說的話。<br>But the king of the children of Ammon would not listen to the words of Jephthah, which he sent him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>11:29</a></td><td class=td>耶和華的靈臨到耶弗他身上，他就經過基列和瑪拿西；他來到基列的米斯巴，又從基列的米斯巴來到亞捫人那裏。<br>And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah. And he passed through Gilead and through Manasseh; and he passed on to Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed on to the children of Ammon.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>11:30</a></td><td class=td>耶弗他向耶和華許願，說，你若真的將亞捫人交在我手中，<br>And Jephthah made a vow to Jehovah, and he said, If You will really deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>11:31</a></td><td class=td>我從亞捫人那裏平平安安回來的時候，無論什麼人，從我家門出來迎接我，就必歸耶和華，我也必將他獻上為燔祭。<br>Whoever comes out through the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon will be Jehovah's, and I will offer  him up as a burnt offering.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>11:32</a></td><td class=td>於是耶弗他往亞捫人那裏去，攻打他們；耶和華將他們交在他手中，<br>And Jephthah passed on to the children of Ammon to fight against them, and Jehovah delivered them into his hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>11:33</a></td><td class=td>他就大大擊殺他們，從亞羅珥到米匿，直到亞備勒基拉明，攻取了二十座城。這樣亞捫人就在以色列人麵前被製伏了。<br>And he struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, twenty cities, and to Abel-keramim, with a very great stroke. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>11:34</a></td><td class=td>耶弗他回米斯巴到了自己的家，不料，他女兒拿著鼓跳舞出來迎接他，是他獨生的，此外無兒無女。<br>Then Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, and there came his daughter out to meet him, with timbrels and with dances. Now she was an only child; he had no son or daughter besides her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>11:35</a></td><td class=td>耶弗他看見她，就撕裂衣服，說，哀哉！我的女兒阿，你使我甚是愁苦，你叫我太作難了；因為我已經向耶和華開口許願，不能收回。<br>And when he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, Ah, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are among those who trouble me. For I have opened my mouth to Jehovah, and I cannot retract it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>11:36</a></td><td class=td>他女兒回答說，我父阿，你既向耶和華開口，就當照你口中所出的向我行，因耶和華已經在你的仇敵亞捫人身上為你報仇；<br>And she said to him, My father, you have opened your mouth to Jehovah; do with me according to what has gone forth from your mouth, seeing that Jehovah has executed vengeance for you on your enemies, on the children of Ammon.</td></tr>
