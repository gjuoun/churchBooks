<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>11:31</a></td><td class=td>在審判的時候，南方的女王要同這世代的人起來，並要定這世代人的罪，因為她從地極來，要聽所羅門的智慧話。看哪，在這裏有比所羅門更大的。<br>The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something more than Solomon is here. </td></tr>
