<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>10:3</a></td><td class=td>你們就可以在你們主人的眾子中，選擇一個最好、最合宜的，使他坐他父親的位，你們也可以為你們主人的家爭戰。<br>Look for the best and fittest of your master's sons, and set him on the throne of his father, and fight for your master's house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>10:4</a></td><td class=td>他們卻甚懼怕，說，二王在他麵前尚且站立不住，我們怎能站得住呢？<br>But they feared very greatly and said, If the two kings could not stand before him, how then can we stand before him?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>10:5</a></td><td class=td>家宰、邑宰、長老、和教養眾子的人，打發人去見耶戶，說，我們是你的仆人；凡你對我們所說的，我們都必遵行。我們不立誰作王，你看怎樣好就怎樣行。<br>And he who was over the household and he that was over the city and the elders and the guardians  sent  to Jehu, saying, We are your servants; all that you say to us, we will do. We will not make anyone king. What is good in your sight, do.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>10:10</a></td><td class=td>由此可知，耶和華指著亞哈家所說的話，一句都沒有落空，因為耶和華藉祂仆人以利亞所說的，祂都成就了。<br>Know therefore that nothing of the word of Jehovah, which Jehovah spoke concerning the house of Ahab, shall fall to the earth; for Jehovah has done that which He spoke through His servant Elijah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>10:11</a></td><td class=td>凡屬亞哈家在耶斯列所剩下的人，和他所有的大臣、朋友、祭司，耶戶盡都殺了，沒有留下一個。<br>So Jehu killed all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel and all his great men and his acquaintances and his priests, until he left him no one remaining.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>10:14</a></td><td class=td>耶戶說，活捉他們。跟從的人就活捉了他們，將他們殺在牧人相聚之處的坑邊，共四十二人，沒有留下一個。<br>And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive and slew them, forty- two men, at the pit of the  meeting place; and he left not one of them remaining.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>10:15</a></td><td class=td>耶戶從那裏前行，恰遇利甲的兒子約拿達來迎接他，耶戶問他安，對他說，你的心對我是不是正直，像我的心對你的心那樣？約拿達說，是。耶戶說，若是這樣，你向我伸手，他就伸手；耶戶拉他上車到自己身邊。<br>And when he departed from there, he came upon Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he  greeted him and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab said, It is. And Jehu said, If it is, give me your hand. And Jehu gave him his hand and took him up to himself into the chariot.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>10:16</a></td><td class=td>耶戶說，你和我同去，看我為耶和華發的熱心；於是請他一同乘車。<br>And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So they made him ride in his chariot.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>10:18</a></td><td class=td>耶戶招聚眾民，對他們說，亞哈隻是稍微事奉巴力，耶戶卻要大大事奉他。<br>And Jehu gathered all the people together and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him much.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>10:19</a></td><td class=td>現在把巴力的眾申言者、一切事奉巴力的人、並巴力的眾祭司，都召到我這裏來，一個也不可缺席，因為我要給巴力獻大祭；凡缺席的必不得活。耶戶這樣用詭計而行，是要殺盡事奉巴力的人。<br>Now call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be missing. For I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal. Whoever is missing will not live. But Jehu acted in subtlety, in order that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>10:20</a></td><td class=td>耶戶說，要為巴力召開嚴肅會。於是他們宣告召開大會。<br>And Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>10:21</a></td><td class=td>耶戶差人走遍全以色列；凡事奉巴力的人都來了，沒有剩下一個不來的。他們進了巴力廟，巴力廟中從這邊到那邊，都滿了人。<br>And Jehu sent word throughout all Israel, and all the worshippers of Baal came; and there was not one left who did not come. And they came to the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>10:22</a></td><td class=td>耶戶吩咐掌管禮服的人說，拿出禮服來，給一切事奉巴力的人穿。他就拿出禮服來給了他們。<br>And he said to the one who was over the wardrobe, Bring out garments for all the worshippers of Baal. And they brought out the garments to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>10:23</a></td><td class=td>耶戶和利甲的兒子約拿達進了巴力廟，對事奉巴力的人說，你們察看察看，在你們這裏不可有耶和華的仆人，隻可有事奉巴力的人。<br>And Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab came to the house of Baal; and he said to the worshippers of Baal, Search and see that none of the servants of Jehovah are here with you; only the worshippers of Baal should be here.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>10:24</a></td><td class=td>耶戶和約拿達進去，獻平安祭和燔祭。耶戶先為自己安排八十人在外麵，說，我將這些人交在你們手中，若有一人脫逃，誰放的必要償命。<br>And they came to offer sacrifice and burnt offerings.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>10:25</a></td><td class=td>耶戶獻完了燔祭，就出來對護衛兵和眾軍長說，你們進去殺他們，不要讓一人出來。護衛兵和軍長就用刀殺他們，將屍首拋出去，並到巴力廟的內堂去，<br>And when he finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guards and to the captains, Go in and slay them; let no one get out. And they struck them with the edge of the sword. And the guards and the captains threw them out, and they went to the  inner room of the house of Baal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>10:26</a></td><td class=td>他們將巴力廟中的柱像都拿出來燒了；<br>And they brought out the pillars of the house of Baal and burned them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>10:27</a></td><td class=td>又毀壞了巴力柱像，拆毀了巴力廟作為廁所，直到今日。<br>And they broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal and made it a latrine, as it is to this day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>10:28</a></td><td class=td>這樣，耶戶從以色列中消滅了巴力。<br>Thus Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>10:32</a></td><td class=td>在那些日子，耶和華開始割削以色列國；哈薛在以色列的四境擊敗他們，<br>In those days Jehovah began to cut away portions of land in Israel, and Hazael struck them in all the borders of Israel</td></tr>
