<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>18:11</a></td><td class=td>所有的申言者也都這樣豫言，說，可以上基列的拉末去，必然順利，因為耶和華必將那城交在王的手中。<br>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and succeed; for Jehovah will deliver it into the king's hand.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>18:15</a></td><td class=td>王對他說，我當嚴嚴的囑咐你多少次，你才在耶和華的名裏向我不說別的，隻說實話呢？<br>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>18:16</a></td><td class=td>米該雅說，我看見以色列眾民散在山上，如同沒有牧人的羊群一般。耶和華說，這些人沒有主人，他們可以平平安安的各歸各家去。<br>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd.
