<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>23:2</a></td><td class=td>所以大衛求問耶和華說，我去攻打這些非利士人，可以不可以？耶和華對大衛說，你可以去攻打非利士人，拯救基伊拉。<br>And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and strike these Philistines? And Jehovah said to David, Go and strike the Philistines, and save Keilah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>23:3</a></td><td class=td>跟隨大衛的人對他說，我們在猶大這裏尚且懼怕，何況往基伊拉去攻擊非利士人的軍旅呢？<br>And David's men said to him, Here we are, afraid here in Judah; how much more if we go to Keilah against the ranks of the Philistines!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>23:4</a></td><td class=td>大衛又求問耶和華。耶和華回答說，你起身下基伊拉去，因我已將非利士人交在你手裏。<br>So David inquired yet again of Jehovah. And Jehovah answered him and said, Rise up; go down to Keilah, for I have delivered the Philistines into your hand.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>23:15</a></td><td class=td>大衛知道掃羅出來尋索他的命。那時，他在西弗曠野的何列斯；<br>And David saw that Saul went forth to seek his life, and David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>23:16</a></td><td class=td>掃羅的兒子約拿單起身，往何列斯去見大衛，使他倚靠神剛強行事；<br>Then Jonathan the son of Saul rose up and went to David at Horesh, and he strengthened his hand in God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>23:17</a></td><td class=td>對他說，不要懼怕。我父親掃羅的手必構不到你；你必作以色列的王，我必在你以下位居第二。這事連我父親掃羅也知道了。<br>And he said to him, Do not be afraid, for the hand of Saul my father will not find you; and you will become king over Israel, and I will be second to you; and even Saul my father knows that.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>23:23</a></td><td class=td>所以要查知他一切藏匿的地方，回來據實告訴我，我就與你們同去；他若在境內，我必從猶大的各家族中搜出他來。<br>And look about and learn of all his hiding places where he lurks, and come back to me with sure information; then I will go with you, and if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>23:24</a></td><td class=td>西弗人就起身，在掃羅以先往西弗去。大衛和跟隨他的人在瑪雲的曠野，在荒野南邊的亞拉巴。<br>And they rose up and went to Ziph before Saul. And David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of the desert.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>23:25</a></td><td class=td>掃羅和跟隨他的人去尋找大衛；有人告訴大衛，他就下到磐石，住在瑪雲的曠野。掃羅聽見，便在瑪雲的曠野追趕大衛。<br>And Saul and his men went to seek  him.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>23:26</a></td><td class=td>掃羅在山這邊走，大衛和跟隨他的人在山那邊走。大衛急忙躲避掃羅；因為掃羅和跟隨他的人，四麵圍住大衛和跟隨他的人，要拿獲他們。<br>And Saul went on one side of the mountain, while David and his men  went on the other side of the mountain.
