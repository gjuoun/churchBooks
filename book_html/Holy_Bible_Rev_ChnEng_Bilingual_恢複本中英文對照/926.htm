<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>1:1</a></td><td class=td>耶和華藉瑪拉基傳給以色列之話語的默示。<br>The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel through Malachi.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>1:2</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，我愛了你們；你們卻說，你在何事上愛了我們呢？耶和華說，以掃不是雅各的哥哥麼？我卻愛雅各，<br>I have loved you, says Jehovah; but you say, How have You loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother, declares Jehovah? Yet I loved Jacob;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>1:3</a></td><td class=td>惡以掃，使他的山嶺荒涼，把他的地業交給曠野的野狗。<br>But Esau I hated, and I made his mountains a desolation, and gave his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>1:4</a></td><td class=td>以東人說，我們現在雖被擊倒，卻要重建荒廢之處；萬軍之耶和華如此說，任他們建造，我必拆毀；他們必稱為罪惡之境，為耶和華永遠惱怒之民。<br>Though Edom says, We are beaten down, but we will return and build up the waste places; thus says Jehovah of hosts, They will build up, but I will throw down; and they will be called the territory of wickedness and the people with whom Jehovah is indignant forever.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>1:6</a></td><td class=td>藐視我名的祭司阿，萬軍之耶和華對你們說，兒子尊敬父親，仆人敬畏主人。我既為父親，我該受的尊敬在那裏呢？我既為主人，我該得的敬畏在那裏呢？你們卻說，我們在何事上藐視你的名呢？<br>A son honors his father, and a servant his lord. Therefore if I am a Father, where is My honor? And if I am the Lord, where is My fear? says Jehovah of hosts to you, O priests who despise My name. But you say, How have we despised Your name?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>1:7</a></td><td class=td>你們將汙穢的食物獻在我的壇上，且說，我們在何事上汙穢你呢？你們竟說，耶和華的桌子是可藐視的。<br>You offer defiled food upon My altar. And you say, How have we defiled You? In that you say, The table of Jehovah is despicable.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>1:8</a></td><td class=td>你們將瞎眼的獻為祭物，這不是惡麼？將瘸腿的、有病的獻上，這不是惡麼？你且把這些獻給你的省長。他豈喜悅你，豈能看你的情麵麼？這是萬軍之耶和華說的。<br>And when you offer what is blind as a sacrifice, is it not evil? And when you offer what is lame and sick, is it not evil? Present it, if you will, to your governor. Will he be pleased with you or accept your person? says Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>

This is what is from your hand. Will He accept any of your persons? says Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>1:10</a></td><td class=td>甚願你們中間有一人關上殿門，免得你們徒然在我壇上燒火！萬軍之耶和華說，我不喜悅你們，也不從你們手中收納供物。<br>Oh, that there were even someone among you who would shut the doors so that you would not kindle fire on My altar in vain! I have no delight in you, says Jehovah of hosts; and I am not pleased with the  sacrifice from your hand.</td></tr>

And in every place incense will be offered to My name as well as a pure sacrifice, for My name will be great among the nations, says Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>

Then you bring what has been stolen and what is lame and what is sick, and you offer it as a sacrifice. Should I be pleased with what comes from your hand? says Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>1:14</a></td><td class=td>行詭詐的在群中有公羊，他許願卻用有殘疾的獻給主，這人是可咒詛的；因為我是大君王，我的名在列國中是可畏的；這是萬軍之耶和華說的。<br>Rather, cursed be the deceiver who has in his flock a male, and when he makes a vow, he offers what is blemished to the Lord; for I am a great King, says Jehovah of hosts, and My name is feared among the nations.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
