<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>21:5</a></td><td class=td>利未子孫作祭司的要近前來；因為耶和華你的神揀選了他們事奉祂，在耶和華的名裏祝福，所有爭訟毆打的事都要憑他們的話判斷。<br>And the priests, the sons of Levi, shall draw near; for Jehovah your God has chosen them to minister to Him and to bless in the name of Jehovah, and by their word shall every dispute and every assault be settled.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>21:17</a></td><td class=td>卻要認所惡之妻生的兒子為長子，將自己一切所有的，分給他雙分；因這兒子是他力量強壯的時候首生的，長子的名分本是他的。<br>But he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the despised woman, giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>21:18</a></td><td class=td>人若有頑梗悖逆的兒子，不聽從父母的話，他們雖然懲治他，他仍不聽從；<br>If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son, one who does not listen to the voice of his father nor to the voice of his mother; and though they chastise him, he does not listen to them;</td></tr>

For he who is hanged is accursed of God, and you shall not defile your land, which Jehovah your God gives you as an inheritance.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
