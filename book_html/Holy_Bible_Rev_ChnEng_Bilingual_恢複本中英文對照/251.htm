<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>15:2</a></td><td class=td>萬軍之耶和華如此說，以色列人從埃及上來的時候，在路上亞瑪力人抵擋他們；為著亞瑪力人向以色列人所作的，我要懲罰他們。<br>Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I will punish the Amalekites  for what they did to Israel when they set themselves against them in the way as they came up out of Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>15:3</a></td><td class=td>現在你要去擊打亞瑪力人，滅絕他們所有的，不可憐惜他們，將男女、孩童、吃奶的，並牛、羊、駱駝和驢，盡都殺死。<br>Go now and strike the Amalekites; and utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, oxen and sheep, camel and donkey.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>15:6</a></td><td class=td>掃羅對基尼人說，去罷，你們離開亞瑪力人下去，恐怕我將你們和亞瑪力人一同殺滅；因為以色列眾人從埃及上來的時候，你們曾以恩慈待他們。於是基尼人離開亞瑪力人去了。<br>And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart; go down from among the Amalekites; otherwise, I will destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>15:9</a></td><td class=td>掃羅和百姓卻憐惜亞甲，也愛惜上好的羊、牛、肥畜、羊羔，並一切美物，不肯滅絕；凡下賤和無價值的，都滅絕了。<br>But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings, and the lambs and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them; but everything that was despised and worthless, this they utterly destroyed.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>15:11</a></td><td class=td>我立掃羅為王，我後悔了；因為他轉去不跟從我，不履行我的話。撒母耳便甚惱怒，終夜哀求耶和華。<br>I repent that I made Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me and has not fulfilled My words. And Samuel was angry, and he cried to Jehovah all night long.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>15:12</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳清早起來，要在早晨迎接掃羅。有人告訴撒母耳說，掃羅去了迦密，在那裏為自己立了記念碑，又回來，經過這裏下到吉甲。<br>Then Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>15:15</a></td><td class=td>掃羅說，這些是從亞瑪力人那裏帶來的；因為百姓愛惜上好的牛羊，要獻與耶和華你的神；其餘的，我們都滅絕了。<br>And Saul said, They have been brought from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to Jehovah your God, and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>15:16</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳對掃羅說，你住口罷，我要將耶和華昨夜向我所說的話告訴你。掃羅說，請講。<br>Then Samuel said to Saul, Stop, and I will tell you what Jehovah spoke to me last night. And he said to him, Speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>15:17</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳說，你雖然以自己為小，豈不是以色列支派的元首麼？耶和華膏了你作以色列的王。<br>And Samuel said, Though you are small in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? And Jehovah has anointed you king over Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>15:18</a></td><td class=td>耶和華差遣你行路，說，你去滅絕那些犯罪的亞瑪力人，攻打他們，直到將他們滅盡。<br>And Jehovah sent you on a journey and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.</td></tr>

And I have brought Agag the king of the Amalekites and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>15:21</a></td><td class=td>百姓卻在所奪得的物中取了牛羊，就是當滅之物中最好的，要在吉甲獻與耶和華你的神。<br>But of the spoil the people took sheep and oxen, the chief of those things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to Jehovah your God in Gilgal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>15:22</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳說，耶和華喜悅燔祭和平安祭，豈如喜悅人聽從祂的話呢？看哪，聽從勝於獻祭；聽命勝於公羊的脂油。<br>And Samuel said, Does Jehovah delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices As much as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,  And to heed, than the fat of rams.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>15:23</a></td><td class=td>悖逆與行邪術的罪相等；頑梗與拜虛神和家神相同。你既厭棄耶和華的話，耶和華也厭棄你作王。<br>For rebellion is  like the sin of divination, And insubordination is  like  idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected the word of Jehovah, He has also rejected you from being king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>15:24</a></td><td class=td>掃羅對撒母耳說，我有罪了，我因懼怕百姓，聽從他們的話，就違犯了耶和華的命令和你的言語。<br>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>15:25</a></td><td class=td>現在求你赦免我的罪，同我回去，我好敬拜耶和華。<br>Now therefore pardon my sin, I beg you, and return with me so that I may worship Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>15:26</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳對掃羅說，我不同你回去；因為你厭棄耶和華的話，耶和華也厭棄你作以色列的王。<br>But Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah has rejected you from being king over Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>15:27</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳轉身要走，掃羅扯住他外袍的衣邊，衣邊就撕斷了。<br>And when Samuel turned around to go, Saul seized the corner of his cloak, and it tore.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>15:28</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳對他說，今日耶和華已將以色列國從你身上撕斷，將這國賜給與你親近的人，他比你更好。<br>And Samuel said to him, Jehovah has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today and has given it to an associate of yours, who is better than you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>15:29</a></td><td class=td>以色列的尊高者必不說謊，也不後悔；因為祂並非人，絕不後悔。<br>Moreover the Eminence of Israel does not lie nor repent, for He is not a man that He should repent.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>15:31</a></td><td class=td>於是撒母耳跟隨掃羅回去，掃羅就敬拜耶和華。<br>So Samuel returned after Saul, and Saul worshipped Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>15:32</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳說，把亞瑪力王亞甲帶到我這裏來。亞甲就歡歡喜喜的來到他那裏，因他心裏說，死亡的苦楚必定轉消了。<br>Then Samuel said, Bring Agag the king of the Amalekites near to me. And Agag came to him cheerfully, for Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death has turned.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>15:33</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳說，你怎樣用刀使婦人喪子，你母親在婦人中也必照樣喪子。於是，撒母耳在吉甲耶和華麵前，將亞甲砍成碎塊。<br>And Samuel said, Just as your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag to pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>15:34</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳往拉瑪去；掃羅也上他所住的基比亞，到自己的家去了。<br>And Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>15:35</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳直到死的日子，再沒有去看掃羅；但撒母耳為掃羅悲傷。耶和華也後悔立掃羅為以色列的王。<br>And Samuel never again saw Saul unto the day of his death, though Samuel mourned for Saul.
