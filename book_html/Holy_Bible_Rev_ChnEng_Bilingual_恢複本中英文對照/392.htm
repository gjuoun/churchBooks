<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>25:4</a></td><td class=td>但他沒有將他們的兒子處死，是照摩西書上律法所寫，耶和華所吩咐的，說，父親不可因兒子的緣故被處死，兒子也不可因父親的緣故被處死；各人要因自己的罪被處死。<br>But their children he did not put to death, but acted according to what is written in the law in the book of Moses, where Jehovah commanded, saying, Fathers shall not be put to death because of their children, nor shall children be put to death because of their fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</td></tr>

Remain now in your home; why should you stir up trouble so that you and Judah with you fall?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>25:20</a></td><td class=td>亞瑪謝卻不肯聽；這是出於神，好將他們交在敵人手裏，因為他們尋求以東的神。<br>But Amaziah would not listen, for it was of God, so that He might deliver them into his hand, for they had sought after the gods of Edom.</td></tr>
