<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>50:1</a></td><td class=td>耶和華如此說，我休了你們的母親，休書在那裏？我將你們賣給我那一個債主呢？看哪，你們被賣，是因你們的罪孽；你們的母親被休，是因你們的過犯。<br>Thus says Jehovah,  Where is the bill of your mother's divorce With which I have put her away? Or to which of My creditors Have I sold you? Indeed, for your iniquities you were sold, And for your transgressions your mother was put away.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>50:2</a></td><td class=td>我來的時候，為何無人等候？我呼喚的時候，為何無人答應？我的手臂豈是縮短，不能救贖麼？我豈無拯救之力麼？看哪，我一斥責，海就幹了；<br>Why when I came was  there no man? And when I called why was there no one to answer? Is My hand so short that it cannot redeem? Or do I have no power to deliver? Indeed, at My rebuke I dry up the  sea; I make the rivers a wilderness; Their fish stink because there is no water, And die of thirst.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>50:3</a></td><td class=td>我使江河變為曠野；其中的魚因無水腥臭，幹渴而死。我使諸天以黑暗為衣服，以麻布為遮蓋。<br>I clothe the heavens with blackness,  And make sackcloth their covering.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>50:4</a></td><td class=td>主耶和華賜我受教者的舌頭，使我知道怎樣用言語扶助疲乏的人。主每早晨喚醒我；祂喚醒我的耳朵，使我能聽，像受教者一樣。<br>The Lord Jehovah has given me The tongue of the instructed, That I should know how to sustain the weary with a word. He awakens me morning by morning; He awakens my ear To hear as an instructed one.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>50:5</a></td><td class=td>主耶和華開通我的耳朵；我並沒有違背，也沒有退後。<br>The Lord Jehovah has opened my  ear; And I was not rebellious, Nor did I turn back.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>50:6</a></td><td class=td>人打我的背，我任他打；人拔我腮頰的胡須，我由他拔；人辱我吐我，我並不掩麵。<br>I gave my back to those who strike  me And my cheeks to those who pluck out the hair; I did not hide my face From humiliation and spitting.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>50:7</a></td><td class=td>主耶和華必幫助我，所以我不抱愧；我硬著臉麵好像堅石，我也知道我必不至蒙羞。<br>The Lord Jehovah helps me; Therefore I have not been dishonored; Therefore I have set my face like a flint, And I know that I will not be put to shame.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>50:8</a></td><td class=td>稱我為義的與我相近；誰與我爭論？我們可以一同站立！誰在審判中與我作對？可以就近我來。<br>The One who justifies me is near; who will contend with me? Let us stand up together! Who is my adversary in judgment? Let him come near to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>50:9</a></td><td class=td>看哪，主耶和華要幫助我；誰能定我有罪？他們都要像衣服漸漸舊了，為蛀蟲所咬。<br>Indeed, the Lord Jehovah helps me, Who is the one who condemns  me? Indeed, they will all wear out like a garment; The moth will consume them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>50:10</a></td><td class=td>你們中間誰敬畏耶和華，聽從祂仆人的聲音，而行在暗中沒有亮光？他當信靠耶和華的名，依賴自己的神。<br>Who among you fears Jehovah; Who hears the voice of His servant; Who walks in darkness And has no light? Let him trust in the name of Jehovah, And rely on his God.</td></tr>

You will have this from My hand: You will lie down in torment.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
