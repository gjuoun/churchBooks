<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>11:2</a></td><td class=td>現在我將真情告訴你。波斯還有三王要興起，第四王必取得財富，遠勝諸王，他因富足成為強盛，就必激動全國攻擊雅完國。<br>And now I will tell you the truth. There will yet arise three kings in Persia; then the fourth will gain great riches, more than all of them; and once he becomes strong because of his riches, he will stir up the whole empire against the realm of Javan.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>11:3</a></td><td class=td>必有一個有能力的王興起，執掌大權，隨意而行。<br>And a mighty king will arise there, and he will rule with great dominion and do as he pleases.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>11:6</a></td><td class=td>過些年後，他們必互相聯合。南方王的女兒，必就了北方王來立盟約；但這女子的勢力存留不住，王和他的勢力，也不能存立；這女子和引導她來聯盟的，並生她的，以及當時扶助她的，都必交與死地。<br>And at the end of some years they will join themselves together. And the daughter of the king of the south will go to the king of the north and make a treaty; but she will not retain the strength of her arm, nor will he and his arm stand; but she will be given up, along with those who brought her into the alliance and him who begot her and supported her in those times.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>11:20</a></td><td class=td>那時必有一人興起接續他的王位，使一暴虐的人通行國中的榮美地；這王不多日就必破滅，卻不是因忿怒，也不是因爭戰。<br>Then there will arise in his place one who will cause an oppressor to pass through the splendor of the kingdom; yet within a few days he will be broken, but not while venting his anger nor pursuing battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>11:21</a></td><td class=td>必有一個卑鄙的人興起接續他的王位，人必不將國的尊榮給他，他卻趁人安穩的時候，用狡猾奸詐的言語行動奪了國。<br>Then there will arise in his place a despicable person, to whom the honor of a kingdom will not be given; but he will come in a time of security and will seize the kingdom  by smooth and cunning words and actions.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>11:23</a></td><td class=td>他與那君結盟之後，必行詭詐；他必上來，以微小的民成為強盛。<br>And once he has made an alliance with him, he will practice deceit and will go up and become mighty with a small group of people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>11:24</a></td><td class=td>他趁人安穩的時候，必進到國中極肥美之地，行他列祖和他列祖之祖所未曾行的；他必將擄物、掠物和財寶，散給眾人；又設計攻打保障，然而這都是暫時的。<br>In a time of security he will enter even the richest parts of the kingdom and will do that which his fathers never did, nor his fathers' fathers; prey, spoil, and riches will he scatter among them, and against strongholds he will  devise strategies, but only for a while.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>11:25</a></td><td class=td>他必奮力鼓勇，率領大軍攻擊南方王；南方王也必以極大極強的軍兵與他爭戰，卻站立不住，因為有人設計謀害南方王。<br>And he will stir up his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south will stir himself up to wage war with an extremely great and mighty army of his own; but he will not stand, for strategies will have been devised against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>11:26</a></td><td class=td>那些吃王膳食的，必毀壞他；他的軍隊必如洪水泛濫，多人必被殺仆倒。<br>And those who eat of his choice provision will destroy him; and his army will overflow, and many will fall down slain.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>11:27</a></td><td class=td>至於這二王，他們心懷邪惡，同席說謊；但所行的必不成功，因為到了定期，結局才來到。<br>And as for both of these kings, their hearts will be to do evil, and they will speak lies across one table; but what they do will not succeed, for the end is still at the appointed time.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>11:28</a></td><td class=td>北方王必帶許多財寶回往本地；他的心卻反對聖約，任意而行，回到本地。<br>Then the  king of the north will return to his land with great riches; but his heart will be set against the holy covenant, and he will take action and will return to his land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>11:29</a></td><td class=td>到了定期，他必返回，來攻南方；但這後一次，卻不如前一次，<br>At the appointed time he will return and come against the south; but this latter time will not be like the former time.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>11:30</a></td><td class=td>因為基提戰船必來攻擊他，他就喪膽而回；又要惱恨聖約，任意而行；他必回來，特別留意背棄聖約的人。<br>For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be disheartened and will turn away; and he will be enraged at the holy covenant and will take action. When he turns away, he will focus his attention on those who forsake the holy covenant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>11:31</a></td><td class=td>他必起兵褻瀆聖所，就是保障，且要除掉日常的獻祭；他們必設立那造成荒涼的可憎之物。<br>And forces from him will arise and profane the sanctuary, establishing the fortress and removing the daily sacrifice; and they will set up the abomination that desolates.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>11:32</a></td><td class=td>作惡違背聖約的人，他必用花言巧語使他們被玷汙；惟獨認識神的子民，必剛強行事。<br>And with his smooth words he will cause those who act wickedly toward the covenant to be profane. But the people who know their God will show strength and take action.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>11:33</a></td><td class=td>民間的通達人，必訓誨多人，然而他們多日必倒在刀下，或被火燒，或被擄掠搶奪。<br>And those with insight among the people will cause the many to understand; yet they will fall by sword and by flames, by captivity and by plundering for some days.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>11:34</a></td><td class=td>他們跌倒的時候，稍得扶助；有許多人隻用諂媚的話依附他們。<br>And when they fall, they will be helped with a little help; and many will join themselves to them  in word only.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>11:35</a></td><td class=td>通達人中有些跌倒的，為要熬煉百姓，使他們純淨潔白，直到末時，因為到了定期，結局才來到。<br>And some of those with insight will fall, in order to refine the people and to purify and cleanse them, until the time of the end, for the end is still at the appointed time.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>11:36</a></td><td class=td>王必任意行事，自高自大，超過所有的神，又用奇異的話攻擊萬神之神；他必行事亨通，直到忿怒完畢，因為所定的事，必然成就。<br>And the king will do as he pleases; and he will exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and against the God of gods he will speak extraordinary things; and he will prosper until the indignation is complete; for what has been determined will be done.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>11:37</a></td><td class=td>他必不顧他列祖的神，也不顧婦女所羨慕的神，無論何神他都不顧，因為他必自大，高過一切。<br>And he will not regard the gods of his fathers or the desire of women, nor will he regard any other god; for he will magnify himself above all.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>11:38</a></td><td class=td>他倒要尊崇保障的神，用金銀寶石和珍寶，敬奉他列祖所不認識的神。<br>But he will honor instead the god of fortresses; indeed a god whom his fathers did not know he will honor with gold, silver, precious stones, and treasures.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>11:39</a></td><td class=td>他必靠外邦神明的幫助，攻擊最堅固的保障；凡承認他的，他必將榮耀加給他們，使他們管轄許多人，又分地賞給他們。<br>And he will take action against the most fortified of fortresses with the help of a foreign god; he will increase the honor of those who acknowledge him and will cause them to rule over many, and he will divide the land to them as a reward.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=40>11:40</a></td><td class=td>到了末時，南方王要與他交戰，北方王必用戰車、馬兵、和許多戰船，勢如暴風來攻擊他，也必進入列國，如洪水衝沒泛濫；<br>And at the time of the end the king of the south will push against him, and the king of the north will storm back at him with chariots and horsemen and many ships; and he will enter the countries and overflow and pass through.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=41>11:41</a></td><td class=td>又必進入榮美之地，有許多國就被傾覆；但以東人、摩押人、和亞捫人中為首的，必脫離他的手。<br>He will also enter the beautiful land, and many countries will fall; but these will slip away from his hand: Edom, Moab, and the foremost of the children of Ammon.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=42>11:42</a></td><td class=td>他必伸手攻擊列國；埃及地也不得逃脫。<br>Then he will stretch forth his hand against the countries, and for the land of Egypt there will be no escape.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=43>11:43</a></td><td class=td>他必把持埃及人隱藏的金銀財寶，和各樣的寶物；呂彼亞人和古實人，都必跟從他的腳步。<br>And he will have control over the hidden stores of gold and silver and over all the precious things of the Egyptians; and the Libyans and Cushites will follow in his steps.</td></tr>
