And the camp of Midian was to their north, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>7:2</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對基甸說，跟隨你的人太多，我不能將米甸人交在他們手中，免得以色列人向我誇大，說，是我們自己的手救了我們。<br>And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people with you are too many for Me to deliver Midian into their hand; Israel might vaunt himself against Me, saying, My own hand has saved me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>7:3</a></td><td class=td>現在你要宣告使百姓聽見，說，凡懼怕戰栗的，可以離開這裏回去。於是有二萬二千人回去，隻剩下一萬。<br>Now then proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, Whoever is afraid and trembling should return and depart from  here. And twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>7:4</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對基甸說，人還是太多；你要帶他們下到水旁，我好在那裏為你試試他們。我指著誰對你說，這人可以同你去，他就可以同你去；我指著誰對你說，這人不可同你去，他就不可同你去。<br>Then Jehovah said to Gideon, The people are still too many. Bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. And he of whom I say to you, This one shall go with you, he shall go with you. And every one of whom I say to you, This one shall not go with you, he shall not go.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>7:5</a></td><td class=td>基甸就帶他們下到水旁。耶和華對基甸說，凡用舌頭舔水，像狗舔的，要使他單站在一處；凡屈膝跪下喝水的，也要使他單站在一處。<br>So he brought the people down to the water. And Jehovah said to Gideon, Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set apart; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>7:6</a></td><td class=td>於是用手捧到嘴邊舔水的有三百人，其餘的人都屈膝跪下喝水。<br>And the number of those who lapped the water into their mouth with their hand was three hundred men, but the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>7:7</a></td><td class=td>耶和華對基甸說，我要用這舔水的三百人拯救你們，將米甸人交在你手中；其餘的人都可以各歸各處去。<br>And Jehovah said to Gideon, Through the three hundred men who lapped I will save you, and I will deliver Midian into your hand. But let all the other people go, each to his own place.</td></tr>

And the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>7:9</a></td><td class=td>當那夜，耶和華對基甸說，起來，下去攻營，因我已將那營交在你手中。<br>And that night Jehovah said to him, Arise; go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>7:10</a></td><td class=td>倘若你怕下去，就帶你的仆人普拉下到營那裏去。<br>But if you are afraid to go down, go down with Purah your young man into the camp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>7:11</a></td><td class=td>你必聽見他們所說的，然後你的手就必得加強，你就能下去攻營。於是基甸帶著仆人普拉下到營邊，靠近部隊。<br>And you will hear what they are saying. Then afterward your hands will be strengthened so that you can go down against the camp. So he went down with Purah his young man to the edge of the battle array that was in the camp.</td></tr>

There was this round loaf of barley bread tumbling through the camp of Midian. And it came to the tent and struck it, so that it fell and turned upside down. And the tent collapsed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>7:14</a></td><td class=td>那同伴回答說，這不是別的，乃是以色列人約阿施的兒子基甸的刀；神已將米甸和全營都交在他的手中。<br>And his companion answered and said, This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has delivered Midian and all the camp into his hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>7:15</a></td><td class=td>基甸聽見這夢的敘述和夢的講解，就敬拜神。他回到以色列營中，說，起來罷，耶和華已將米甸營交在你們手中了。<br>And when Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he worshipped. And he returned to the camp of Israel and said, Arise, for Jehovah has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>7:16</a></td><td class=td>於是基甸將三百人分作三隊，把角和空瓶交在各人手裏，瓶內都有火把。<br>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies; and he put trumpets into the hands of them all, as well as empty pitchers, with torches inside the pitchers.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>7:18</a></td><td class=td>我和一切跟隨我的人吹角的時候，你們也要在全營的四圍吹角，喊叫說，耶和華和基甸的刀！!<br>When I and all who are with me blow the trumpet, you also blow the trumpets around all the camp and say, For Jehovah and for Gideon!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>7:19</a></td><td class=td>基甸和跟隨他的一百人，在二更之初，才換更的時候，來到營邊，就吹角，打破手中的瓶。<br>So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch. They had just then posted the watch. And they blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.</td></tr>

And they cried out, A sword for Jehovah and for Gideon!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>7:21</a></td><td class=td>他們在營的四圍各站各的地方；全營的人都亂竄，一麵喊叫，一麵逃跑。<br>And each man stood in his place around the camp. Then the whole camp ran off, and they shouted and fled.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>7:22</a></td><td class=td>三百人吹響三百枝角，耶和華使全營的人用刀互相擊殺，他們向西利拉逃到伯哈示他，直逃到靠近他巴，亞伯米何拉的河邊。<br>And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and Jehovah set each man's sword against his companion and against the whole camp. And the camp fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>7:23</a></td><td class=td>以色列人就從拿弗他利、亞設、和全瑪拿西，應召來追趕米甸人。<br>And the men of Israel were called up from Naphtali and from Asher and from all of Manasseh, and they pursued after Midian.</td></tr>

And every man of Ephraim was called up, and they seized the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.</td></tr>
