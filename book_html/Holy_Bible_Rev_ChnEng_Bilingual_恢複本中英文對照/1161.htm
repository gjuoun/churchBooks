<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>我的孩子們，我將這些事寫給你們，是要叫你們不犯罪。若有人犯罪，我們有一位與父同在的辯護者，就是那義者耶穌基督；<br>My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>祂為我們的罪，作了平息的祭物，不是單為我們的罪，也是為所有的世人。<br>And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>我們若遵守祂的誡命，在此就知道我們是認識祂。<br>And in this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>那說我認識祂，卻不遵守祂誡命的，便是說謊的，真理也不在這人裏麵了；<br>He who says, I know Him, and does not keep His commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in this one; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>然而凡遵守祂話的，神的愛在這人裏麵實在是得了成全。在此我們就知道我們是在祂裏麵。<br>But whoever keeps His word, truly in this one the love of God has been perfected. In this we know that we are in Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>那說自己住在祂裏麵的，就該照祂所行的去行。<br>He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk even as He walked. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>親愛的，我寫給你們的，不是一條新誡命，乃是一條你們從起初就有的舊誡命，這舊誡命就是你們所聽見的話。<br>Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you but an old commandment, which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you heard. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>再者，我寫給你們的是一條新誡命，這在主並在你們都是真的；因為黑暗漸漸過去，真光已經照耀。<br>Yet again a new commandment I am writing to you, which is true in Him and in you because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>那說自己在光中，卻恨他弟兄的，到如今還是在黑暗裏。<br>He who says he is in the light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>那愛他弟兄的，就住在光中，在他並沒有絆跌的緣由；<br>He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause of stumbling in him; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>但那恨他弟兄的，是在黑暗裏，且在黑暗裏行，也不知道往那裏去，因為黑暗弄瞎了他的眼睛。<br>But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>孩子們，我寫信給你們，因為你們的罪因著祂的名得了赦免。<br>I write to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you because of His name. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>父老們，我寫信給你們，因為你們認識那從起初原有的。青年人，我寫信給你們，因為你們勝了那惡者。小孩子們，我寫信給你們，因為你們認識父。<br>I write to you, fathers, because you know Him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, young children, because you know the Father. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>父老們，我剛寫信給你們，因為你們認識那從起初原有的。青年人，我剛寫信給你們，因為你們剛強，神的話住在你們裏麵，你們也勝了那惡者。<br>I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong and the word of God abides in you and you have overcome the evil one. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>不要愛世界，和世界上的事。人若愛世界，愛父的心就不在他裏麵了；<br>Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>因為凡世界上的事，就是肉體的情欲、眼目的情欲、並今生的驕傲，都不是出於父，乃是出於世界。<br>Because all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father but is of the world. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>這世界和其上的情欲，正在過去；惟獨實行神旨意的，永遠長存。<br>And the world is passing away, and its lust, but he who does the will of God abides forever. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>小孩子們，如今是末時了；你們曾聽見，那敵基督的要來，現在已經有好些敵基督的出來了，從此我們就知道如今是末時了。<br>Young children, it is the last hour; and even as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come; whereby we know that it is the last hour. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>他們從我們中間出去，卻不是屬我們的；若是屬我們的，就會仍舊與我們同在；但他們出去，是要顯明他們都不是屬我們的。<br>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out that they might be manifested that they all are not of us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>2:20</a></td><td class=td>你們有從那聖者來的膏油塗抹，並且你們眾人都知道。<br>And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>2:21</a></td><td class=td>我剛寫信給你們，不是因你們不曉得真理，正是因為你們曉得，又因為沒有虛謊是出於真理的。<br>I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it and because no lie is of the truth. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>2:22</a></td><td class=td>誰是說謊的？不是那否認耶穌是基督的麼？否認父與子的，這就是敵基督的。<br>Who is the liar if not he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>2:23</a></td><td class=td>凡否認子的就沒有父，承認子的連父也有了。<br>Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>2:24</a></td><td class=td>至於你們，務要讓那從起初所聽見的住在你們裏麵；那從起初所聽見的若住在你們裏麵，你們也就住在子裏麵，並住在父裏麵。<br>As for you, that which you heard from the beginning, let it abide in you. If that which you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>2:25</a></td><td class=td>祂所應許我們的，就是那永遠的生命。<br>And this is the promise which He Himself promised us, the eternal life. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>2:26</a></td><td class=td>我剛將這些話寫給你們，是指著那些迷惑你們的人說的。<br>These things I have written to you concerning those who lead you astray. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>2:27</a></td><td class=td>你們從祂所領受的膏油塗抹，住在你們裏麵，並不需要人教導你們，乃有祂的膏油塗抹，在凡事上教導你們；這膏油塗抹是真實的，不是虛謊的，你們要按這膏油塗抹所教導你們的，住在祂裏麵。<br>And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>2:28</a></td><td class=td>現在，孩子們，你們要住在主裏麵；這樣，祂若顯現，我們就可以坦然無懼，當祂來臨的時候，也不至於蒙羞離開祂。<br>And now, little children, abide in Him, so that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>2:29</a></td><td class=td>你們若曉得祂是義的，就當知道凡行義的人也都是從祂生的。<br>If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness also has been begotten of Him. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
