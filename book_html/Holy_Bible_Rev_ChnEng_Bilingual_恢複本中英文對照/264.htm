<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>28:1</a></td><td class=td>那些日子，非利士人聚集軍旅，要攻打以色列。亞吉對大衛說，你要清楚知道，你和跟隨你的人都要隨我出戰。<br>Then in those days the Philistines gathered their camps together for war to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, Know assuredly that you shall go out with me into the camp, you and your men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>28:2</a></td><td class=td>大衛對亞吉說，既是如此，仆人所能作的事，王必知道。亞吉對大衛說，這樣，我立你永遠作我的護衛。<br>And David said to Achish, This being so, you will know what your servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore I will make you my bodyguard for life.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>28:3</a></td><td class=td>那時撒母耳已經死了，全以色列為他哀哭，將他埋葬在拉瑪，就是在他本城裏。掃羅曾將交鬼的和行巫術的人驅逐出境。<br>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him; and they had buried him in Ramah, that is, in his own city. And Saul had the mediums and the soothsayers put out of the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>28:4</a></td><td class=td>非利士人聚集，來到書念安營；掃羅將全以色列聚集起來，在基利波安營。<br>And the Philistines gathered together, and they came and encamped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>28:5</a></td><td class=td>掃羅看見非利士人的軍旅就懼怕，心中大大發顫。<br>And when Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>28:6</a></td><td class=td>掃羅求問耶和華，耶和華卻不藉夢、或烏陵、或申言者回答他。<br>And Saul inquired of Jehovah; but Jehovah did not answer him, not by dreams or by the Urim or by the prophets.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>28:7</a></td><td class=td>掃羅對臣仆說，當為我找一個交鬼的婦人，我好去問她。臣仆說，看哪，在隱多珥有一個交鬼的婦人。<br>Then said Saul to his servants, Seek for me a woman who is a medium that I may go to her and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, There is now a woman who is a medium at En-dor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>28:8</a></td><td class=td>於是掃羅改了裝，穿上別的衣服，帶著兩個人，夜裏去見那婦人。掃羅說，求你用交鬼的法術為我問吉凶，將我所告訴你的死人，為我招上來。<br>Then Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes. And he and two men with him went, and they came to the woman by night. And he said, Consult a departed spirit for me, and bring up to me the one whom I tell you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>28:9</a></td><td class=td>婦人對他說，看哪，你知道掃羅所作的，他已將交鬼的和行巫術的從這地剪除。你為何陷害我的性命，使我死呢？<br>But the woman said to him, Look, you know what Saul has done, that he has cut off the mediums and the soothsayers from the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my life to make me die?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>28:10</a></td><td class=td>掃羅向婦人指著耶和華起誓說，我指著永活的耶和華起誓，你必不因這事受刑。<br>Then Saul swore to her by Jehovah, saying,  As Jehovah lives, no punishment shall happen to you for this thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>28:11</a></td><td class=td>婦人說，我為你招誰上來呢？掃羅說，為我招撒母耳上來。<br>So the woman said, Whom shall I bring up to you? And he said, Bring up Samuel to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>28:12</a></td><td class=td>婦人看見撒母耳，就大聲呼叫，對掃羅說，你是掃羅，為什麼欺哄我呢？<br>Now when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>28:13</a></td><td class=td>王對婦人說，不要懼怕，你看見了什麼？婦人對掃羅說，我看見有神明從地裏上來。<br>And the king said to her, Do not be afraid. But what do you see? And the woman said to Saul, I see some divine being coming up out of the earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>28:14</a></td><td class=td>掃羅說，他是怎樣的形狀？婦人說，有一個老人上來，身穿長袍。掃羅知道是撒母耳，就屈身，麵伏於地下拜。<br>And he said to her, What is his appearance? And she said, An old man is coming up; and he is wrapped in a cloak. Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with  his face to the ground and paid  him homage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>28:15</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳對掃羅說，你為什麼攪擾我，招我上來？掃羅回答說，我甚窘急；因為非利士人攻擊我，神也離開我，不再藉申言者或夢回答我。因此我呼喚你，請你指示我應當怎樣行。<br>And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up? And Saul said, I am greatly distressed; for the Philistines wage war against me, and God has turned away from me and answers me no more, neither through the prophets nor by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>28:16</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳說，既然耶和華已經離開你，且與你為敵，你何必問我呢？<br>And Samuel said, Why then have you inquired of me? For Jehovah has turned away from you and become your adversary.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>28:17</a></td><td class=td>耶和華已經親自照著祂藉我所說的話行了；祂已經從你手裏奪去國權，賜給與你親近的人，就是大衛。<br>And Jehovah has done for Himself just as He spoke through me, for Jehovah has torn the kingdom out from your hand and given it to an associate of yours, to David.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>28:18</a></td><td class=td>因你沒有聽從耶和華的話，沒有在亞瑪力人身上執行祂的烈怒，所以今日耶和華向你行了這事。<br>Because you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah and did not execute His burning anger upon the Amalekites, therefore Jehovah has done this thing to you this day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>28:19</a></td><td class=td>耶和華也必將以色列同你交在非利士人的手裏，明日你和你眾子必與我在一處了；耶和華也必將以色列的軍兵交在非利士人手裏。<br>And Jehovah will also give Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me; Jehovah will also give the camp of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>28:20</a></td><td class=td>掃羅全身猛然仆倒在地，因撒母耳的話甚是懼怕；那一晝一夜沒有吃什麼，就毫無力氣<br>Then immediately Saul fell his full length to the ground, and he was very afraid because of Samuel's words. And there was no strength in him, for he had not eaten food all day and all night.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>28:21</a></td><td class=td>婦人到掃羅麵前，見他極其驚惶，就對他說，看哪，婢女聽了你的話；我不顧惜自己的性命，聽了你對我所說的話。<br>And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was very troubled. And she said to him, Indeed, your servant has listened to your voice; and I have put my life in my hand and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>28:22</a></td><td class=td>現在求你也聽婢女的話，讓我在你麵前擺上一點食物；你要吃，好有力氣行路。<br>Now therefore, you listen also to the voice of your servant, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>28:23</a></td><td class=td>掃羅不肯，說，我不吃。但他的仆人和婦人都勉強他，他才聽了他們的話，從地上起來，坐在床上。<br>But he refused and said, I will not eat. Then his servants, as well as the woman, compelled him, and he listened to their voice; and he rose up from the ground and sat on the bed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>28:24</a></td><td class=td>婦人家裏有一隻肥牛犢；她急忙將肥牛犢宰了，又拿麵摶成無酵餅烤了，擺在掃羅和他仆人麵前。他們吃完，當夜就起身走了。<br>And the woman had a fattened calf in the house; and she hurried and killed it, and took flour and kneaded  it, and baked unleavened bread with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>28:25</a></td><td class=td>擺在掃羅和他仆人麵前。他們吃完，當夜就起身走了。<br>And she brought  it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. And they rose up and went away that night.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
