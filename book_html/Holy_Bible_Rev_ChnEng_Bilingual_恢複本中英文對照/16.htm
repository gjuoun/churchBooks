I gave my female servant into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. May Jehovah judge between me and you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>16:6</a></td><td class=td>亞伯蘭對撒萊說，使女在你手下，你看怎樣好，就怎樣待她罷。於是撒萊苦待她，她就從撒萊麵前逃走了。<br>And Abram said to Sarai, Your female servant is now in your hand; do to her what is good in your eyes. So Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from before her.</td></tr>
