<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>1:1</a></td><td class=td>先前滿有人民的城，現在何竟獨坐！先前在列國中為大的，現在竟如寡婦；先前在諸省中為王後的，現在成了進貢的。<br>How the city sits alone That was full of people! She who was once great among the nations Has become like a widow; She who was a princess among the provinces Has become tributary.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>1:2</a></td><td class=td>她夜間痛哭，淚流滿腮。在她一切所愛的人中間，沒有一個安慰她的；她的朋友，都以詭詐待她，成了她的仇敵。<br>Bitterly she weeps in the night, And her tears are on her cheeks. There is no one to comfort her Among all her lovers; All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; They have become her enemies.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>1:3</a></td><td class=td>猶大遭遇苦難，多服勞役，被遷到外邦；她住在列國中，尋不著安息；在急難中，一切追逼她的人將她追上了。<br>Judah has gone into exile, away from affliction And away from great servitude; She dwells among the nations But finds no rest; All her pursuers have overtaken her In the midst of distress.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>1:4</a></td><td class=td>錫安的路徑，因無人來守所定的節期就悲傷；她的城門淒涼，她的祭司歎息；她的處女受艱難，自己也在愁苦中。<br>The ways of Zion mourn, For no one comes to the appointed feast; All her gates are desolate; Her priests groan; Her virgins are afflicted, And she is in bitterness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>1:5</a></td><td class=td>她的敵人為首；她的仇敵亨通；因為她的過犯眾多，耶和華使她受苦；她的孩童在敵人麵前被擄去。<br>Her adversaries have become the head; Her enemies prosper; For Jehovah has afflicted her Because of the multitude of her transgressions; Her little ones have gone into  captivity Before the adversary.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>1:6</a></td><td class=td>錫安女子的威榮，全都離去；她的首領，像找不著草場的鹿，在追趕的人麵前，無力行走。<br>And all her majesty has departed From the daughter of Zion; Her princes have become like deer That find no pasture, And they have fled without strength Before the pursuer.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>1:7</a></td><td class=td>耶路撒冷在困苦流離之時，就追想古時一切的美事；她百姓落在敵人手中，無人救助；敵人看見她，就嗤笑她的衰敗。<br>In the days of her affliction and her wanderings, Jerusalem remembers All her precious things Which were in the days of old, When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, And there was no one to help her. The adversaries saw her; They mocked at her downfall.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>1:8</a></td><td class=td>耶路撒冷大大的犯罪，所以成了不潔之物。素來尊敬她的，見她赤露就都藐視她；她自己也歎息，轉身退後。<br>Jerusalem has sinned grievously; Therefore she has become an impurity. All who honored her despise her, Because they have seen her nakedness; And she groans And turns backwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>1:9</a></td><td class=td>她的汙穢是在衣裙上；她不思想自己末後的結局；所以她令人驚奇的敗落，無人安慰她。她說，耶和華阿，求你看我的苦難，因為仇敵自誇為大。<br>Her uncleanness is in her skirts; She did not remember her latter end; Therefore she has come down astonishingly; There is no one to comfort her. O Jehovah, see my affliction, For the enemy has magnified himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>1:10</a></td><td class=td>敵人伸手，奪取她的一切美物；她眼見外邦人進入她的聖所；論到這外邦人，你曾吩咐不可入你的會中。<br>The adversary has spread out his  hand Over all her precious things, For she has seen the nations Enter her sanctuary, Concerning whom You commanded that they should not enter Into Your assembly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>1:11</a></td><td class=td>她的民都歎息，尋求食物；他們用美物換糧食，要救回性命。他們說，耶和華阿，求你觀看，因為我成了被藐視的。<br>All her people groan; They seek bread; They have given their precious things for food To restore their soul. See, O Jehovah, and look, For I have become despised.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>1:12</a></td><td class=td>你們一切過路的人哪，這事你們不介意麼？你們要觀看，有什麼痛苦像我所遭受的痛苦，就是耶和華在祂發烈怒的日子，使我所受的苦。<br>Is it nothing to you, all who pass by the way? Look and see If there is any pain like my pain Which is dealt to me, Whom Jehovah has afflicted In the day of His burning anger.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>1:13</a></td><td class=td>祂從高天使火進入我的骨頭，勝過了我；祂鋪下網羅，絆我的腳，使我轉回退後；祂使我終日淒涼發昏。<br>He has sent fire from on high Into my bones, and it prevails against them; He has spread out a net for my feet; He has turned me back; He has made me a desolation And faint all the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>1:14</a></td><td class=td>我過犯的軛，是祂手所綁的，都糾纏在一起，上到我的頸項；祂使我的力量衰敗。主將我交在我所不能敵擋的人手中。<br>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by His hand; They are knit together; They have come up upon my neck; He has made my strength fail; The Lord has delivered me into  hands From which I am not able to rise  up.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>1:15</a></td><td class=td>主輕棄我中間的一切勇士；祂招聚會眾攻擊我，要壓碎我的少年人。主將猶大的處女踹踏，像在酒醡中一樣。<br>The Lord has made light of all my mighty men In my midst; He has called an assembly against  me To crush my young men. The Lord has trodden, as in a  winepress, The virgin daughter of Judah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>1:16</a></td><td class=td>我因這些事哭泣；我的眼睛淚水直流，因為那當安慰我，救回我性命的，離我甚遠；我的兒女淒苦，因為仇敵已經得勝。<br>For these things I weep; My eye, my eye runs down with water, For the comforter who should revive my soul Is far from me; My children have become desolate, Because the enemy has prevailed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>1:17</a></td><td class=td>錫安伸出雙手，無人安慰；論到雅各，耶和華已經出令，使四圍的人作他仇敵；耶路撒冷在他們中間，成了不潔之物。<br>Zion stretches out her hands, Yet there is no one to comfort  her. Jehovah has commanded concerning Jacob That those around him should be his adversaries; Jerusalem has become an impurity Among them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>1:18</a></td><td class=td>耶和華是公義的，因我違背了祂的命令。眾民哪，請聽我的話，看我的痛苦；我的處女和少年人，都被擄去了。<br>Jehovah is righteous, For I have rebelled against His commandment. Hear now, all the peoples, And see my pain; My virgins and my young men Have gone into captivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>1:19</a></td><td class=td>我招呼我所愛的人，他們卻愚弄我；我的祭司和長老，正尋求食物要救回性命的時候，就在城中滅亡。<br>I have called to my lovers; They have deceived me; My priests and my elders Have perished in the city, While they sought food for  themselves To restore their souls.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>1:20</a></td><td class=td>耶和華阿，求你觀看，因為我在急難中，我的心腸翻騰；我的心在我裏麵翻轉，因我曾經大大的悖逆。在街上刀劍使人喪子，在屋裏猶如死亡。<br>See, O Jehovah, for I am in  distress, My bowels are in ferment; My heart is overturned within me, For I have been very rebellious. In the street the sword bereaves; In the house it is like death.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>1:21</a></td><td class=td>他們聽見我歎息，卻無人安慰我；我的仇敵都聽見我的患難；因你作了這事，他們就都歡喜。你必使你宣告的日子來到，他們就要像我一樣。<br>They have heard that I groan; There is no one to comfort me; All my enemies have heard of my trouble; They are glad that You have done  it. You will bring the day that You have proclaimed, And they will be like me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>1:22</a></td><td class=td>願他們的惡，都呈到你麵前；你怎樣因我的一切過犯待我，求你照樣待他們；因我歎息甚多，我的心發昏。<br>Let all their wickedness come  before You, And deal with them As You have dealt with me For all my transgressions; For my sighs are many, And my heart is faint.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
