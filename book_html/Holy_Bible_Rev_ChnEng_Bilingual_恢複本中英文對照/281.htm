<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>14:1</a></td><td class=td>洗魯雅的兒子約押，知道王的心掛念押沙龍，<br>And Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was  set on Absalom.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>14:2</a></td><td class=td>就打發人往提哥亞去，從那裏帶了一個聰明的婦人來，對她說，請你假裝居喪的，穿上喪服，不要用油抹身，要裝作為死者居喪多日的婦人；<br>So Joab sent  word to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there. And he said to her, Pretend to be in mourning, and put on mourning garments, and do not anoint yourself with oil; but be like a woman who has mourned for the dead a long time.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>14:3</a></td><td class=td>進去見王，對王如此如此說。於是約押將當說的話教導了婦人。<br>And go to the king and speak with him in this way. And Joab put the words in her mouth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>14:4</a></td><td class=td>提哥亞婦人進去對王說話；她麵伏於地叩拜，說，王阿，求你拯救！<br>And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and paid  him homage and said, Help, O king!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>14:5</a></td><td class=td>王問她說，你有什麼事？她說，我實在是寡婦，我丈夫死了。<br>And the king said to her, What troubles you? And she said, Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>14:6</a></td><td class=td>你婢女有兩個兒子，一日他們二人在田間爭鬥，沒有人從中排解，這個就把那個打死了。<br>And your servant had two sons. And the two struggled with each other in the field, and there was no one to part them. So the one struck down the other and killed him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>14:7</a></td><td class=td>現在全家族的人都起來攻擊你的婢女，說，你將那打死兄弟的交出來，我們好將他處死，償他所打死兄弟的命；即使是承受家業的，我們也要滅絕。這樣，他們要將我剩下的炭火滅盡，不給我丈夫留名留後在地上。<br>And now the whole family has risen up against your servant, and they say, Give over that one who struck down his brother that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he has slain, even if we destroy the heir also. Thus they will quench my coal which is left without leaving to my husband a name or a remainder on the face of the earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>14:8</a></td><td class=td>王對婦人說，你回家去罷，我必為你下令。<br>Then the king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will issue a command concerning you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>14:9</a></td><td class=td>提哥亞婦人又對王說，我主我王，願這罪孽歸我和我父家，與王和王的位無幹。<br>And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, O my lord the king, the iniquity be upon me and upon the house of my father, and the king and his throne be guiltless.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>14:10</a></td><td class=td>王說，對你說這事的，你就帶他到我這裏來，他必不再打擾你。<br>And the king said, If anyone says  anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you any more.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>14:11</a></td><td class=td>婦人說，願王記念耶和華你的神，不許報血仇的人施行殺滅，恐怕他們滅絕我的兒子。王說，我指著永活的耶和華起誓，你的兒子連一根頭發也不至落在地上。<br>And she said, May the king remember Jehovah your God, so that the avenger of blood may kill no more and they destroy not my son. And he said, As Jehovah lives, not a hair from your son shall fall to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>14:12</a></td><td class=td>婦人說，請讓婢女向我主我王說一句話。王說，你說罷。<br>Then the woman said, Let your servant speak a word to my lord the king. And he said, Speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>14:13</a></td><td class=td>婦人說，王為何想出這樣的事，要害神的民呢？王不使他所趕逐的那人回來，王說這話就不免有罪了。<br>And the woman said, Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word, the king is like one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring back his banished one.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>14:14</a></td><td class=td>我們都是必死的，如同水潑在地上，不能收回。神並不奪取人的性命，乃設法使被趕逐的人不至被趕逐永遠離開祂。<br>For we must die and are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered  again. Yet God does not take away life, but devises ways that the banished one would not be cast out from Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>14:15</a></td><td class=td>如今我來將這話告訴我主我王，是因百姓使我懼怕；婢女想，讓我告訴王，也許王會成就婢女所求的。<br>Now therefore that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people made me afraid; and your servant said, I will now speak to the king; perhaps the king will perform his servant's request.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>14:16</a></td><td class=td>人要將我和我兒子從神的產業中一同除滅，王必應允救婢女脫離那人的手。<br>For the king will hear and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>14:17</a></td><td class=td>婢女又想，願我主我王的話安慰我；因為我主我王能辨別善惡，如同神的使者一樣。惟願耶和華你的神與你同在。<br>Then your servant said, Let the word of my lord the king be a comfort  to me, for as an angel of God is, so is my lord the king in discerning good and evil; and may Jehovah your God be with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>14:18</a></td><td class=td>王回答婦人說，我要問你一件事，你不要瞞著我。婦人說，願我主我王說。<br>And the king answered and said to the woman, Do not hide the matter from me which I will ask of you. And the woman said, Let my lord the king speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>14:19</a></td><td class=td>王說，這一切事莫非是約押一手安排的麼？婦人回答說，我主我王阿，我指著你的性命起誓，我主我王的話正對，不偏左右，是王的仆人約押吩咐我的，這一切話是他教導你婢女的。<br>And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this? And the woman answered and said, As your soul lives, O my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or left of anything that my lord the king has said; for your servant Joab commanded me, and it is he who has put all these words in the mouth of your servant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>14:20</a></td><td class=td>你的仆人約押行這事，為要使事情有轉圜；我主卻有智慧，如神使者的智慧一樣，能知地上一切的事。<br>In order to change the appearance of the matter, your servant Joab did this thing; and my lord is wise, as wise as an angel of God, knowing all that there is in the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>14:21</a></td><td class=td>王對約押說，看哪，我應允你這事。你可以去，把那少年人押沙龍帶回來。<br>Then the king said to Joab, I will now do this thing; go therefore,  and bring the young man Absalom back.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>14:22</a></td><td class=td>約押就麵伏於地叩拜，稱謝王，又說，王既應允仆人的事，我主我王阿，你仆人今日知道自己在你眼前蒙恩了。<br>And Joab fell on his face to the ground and paid homage and blessed the king; and Joab said, Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, O my lord the king, in that the king has granted his servant's request.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>14:23</a></td><td class=td>於是約押起身往基述去，將押沙龍帶回耶路撒冷。<br>Then Joab rose up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>14:24</a></td><td class=td>王說，使他回自己家裏去，不要見我的麵。押沙龍就回自己家裏去，沒有見王的麵。<br>And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house and did not see the king's face.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>14:25</a></td><td class=td>全以色列之中，無人像押沙龍那樣俊美，大得人的稱讚；他從腳底到頭頂毫無瑕疵。<br>Now there was none in Israel to be praised more greatly for his beauty than Absalom; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>14:26</a></td><td class=td>他每到年底剪發一次；因為頭上積發甚重，他就剪去；他把每次剪下的頭發稱一稱，按王的法碼重二百舍客勒。<br>And when he cut  the hair of his head (and it was at the end of each year that he cut  it, for it became heavy on him and he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, according to the king's weight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>14:27</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍得了三個兒子，一個女兒；女兒名叫他瑪，是個容貌美麗的女子。<br>And to Absalom were born three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of beautiful appearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>14:28</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍住在耶路撒冷足有二年，沒有見王的麵。<br>And Absalom dwelt in Jerusalem for two full years and did not see the king's face.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>14:29</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍打發人去叫約押來，要差他去見王，約押卻不肯來。第二次打發人去叫他，他仍不肯來。<br>Then Absalom sent for Joab so that he might send him to the king, but he would not come to him. And he sent  for him yet a second time, but he would not come.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>14:30</a></td><td class=td>所以押沙龍對仆人說，你們看，約押有一塊田，與我的田相近，他有大麥在那裏，你們去放火燒了。押沙龍的仆人就去放火燒了那塊田。<br>Then he said to his servants, See, Joab's portion of land is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. So Absalom's servants set the portion of land on fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>14:31</a></td><td class=td>於是約押起來，到押沙龍家裏，問他說，你的仆人為何放火燒了我的那塊田呢？<br>And Joab rose up and came to Absalom at his house; and he said to him, Why did your servants set my portion of land on fire?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>14:32</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍對約押說，我打發人去見你，說，請你來，我要差你去見王，替我說，我為何從基述回來呢？不如仍在那裏。現在請讓我見王的麵；我身上若有罪孽，任憑王把我處死就是了。<br>And Absalom said to Joab, I sent for you, saying, Come now that I may send you to the king to say, Why have I come from Geshur? It would have been better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there is any iniquity in me, let him put me to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>14:33</a></td><td class=td>於是約押去見王，將這話奏告王，王便叫押沙龍來。押沙龍來見王，在王麵前麵伏於地叩拜，王就與押沙龍親嘴。<br>So Joab went to the king and spoke to him, and he called for Absalom. And he came to the king and bowed himself with his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
