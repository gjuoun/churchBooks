<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>6:1</a></td><td class=td>申言者的門徒對以利沙說，看哪，我們同你所住的地方過於窄小，<br>Then the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, The place here where we dwell before you is too narrow for us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>6:2</a></td><td class=td>求你讓我們到約但河去，各人從那裏取一根木料，在那裏為我們自己造個處所居住。他說，你們去罷。<br>Let us go to the Jordan and each take a beam from there, and let us make for ourselves a place there, where we may dwell. And he said, Go.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>6:3</a></td><td class=td>有一人說，求你與仆人們同去。他說，我去。<br>And someone said, Please go with your servants. And he said, I will go.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>6:4</a></td><td class=td>於是以利沙與他們同去。他們到了約但河，就砍伐樹木。<br>And he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down the trees.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>6:5</a></td><td class=td>有一人砍伐木料的時候，斧頭掉在水裏，他就呼叫說，哀哉！我主阿，這斧子是借來的。<br>But as one was felling a beam, the  ax head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, Alas, my master! It was borrowed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>6:6</a></td><td class=td>神人問說，掉在那裏了？他將那地方指給以利沙看。以利沙砍了一根木頭，拋在那裏，就使斧頭浮上來。<br>And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick and threw it there and made the iron float.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>6:7</a></td><td class=td>以利沙說，你自己拿上來罷。那人就伸手把斧頭拿起來。<br>And he said, Take it up for yourself. And he stretched out his hand and took it.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>6:9</a></td><td class=td>神人打發人去見以色列王，說，你要謹慎，不要從某處經過，因為亞蘭人從那裏下來了。<br>And the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that you do not pass such a place, for the Syrians are going down there.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>6:11</a></td><td class=td>亞蘭王因這事心裏驚疑，召了臣仆來，對他們說，我們這裏有誰幫助以色列王，你們不告訴我麼？<br>And the heart of the king of Syria was enraged over this matter. And he called his servants and said to them, Tell me, which of us sides with the king of Israel?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>6:12</a></td><td class=td>有一個臣仆說，我主我王阿，無人幫助他；隻有以色列中的申言者以利沙，將王在臥房裏所說的話告訴以色列王了。<br>And one of his servants said, None, my lord O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words which you speak in your bedroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>6:13</a></td><td class=td>王說，你們去看看他在那裏，我好打發人去捉拿他。有人告訴王說，他在多坍。<br>And he said, Go and see where he is, that I may send for him and seize him. And it was told him, saying, He is in Dothan.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>6:14</a></td><td class=td>王就打發車馬和大軍往那裏去，在夜間來到，包圍那城。<br>And he sent horses and chariots and a massive army there. And they came by night and surrounded the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>6:15</a></td><td class=td>神人的侍從清早起來出去，看見車馬軍兵包圍了城。少年人對神人說，哀哉！我主阿，我們怎樣行才好？<br>And the servant of the man of God rose early and went out, and there it was: an army with horses and chariots surrounding the city. And his attendant said to him, Alas, my master! What shall we do?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>6:16</a></td><td class=td>神人說，不要懼怕，因為與我們同在的，比與他們同在的更多。<br>And he said, Do not fear, for they who are with us are more than they who are with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>6:17</a></td><td class=td>以利沙禱告說，耶和華阿，求你開他的眼目，使他能看見。耶和華開少年人的眼目，他就看見滿山有火車火馬圍繞以利沙。<br>And Elisha prayed and said, O Jehovah, open his eyes that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the attendant, and he saw: The mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>6:18</a></td><td class=td>亞蘭人下到以利沙那裏，以利沙禱告耶和華說，求你擊打這民，使他們眼目昏迷。耶和華就照以利沙的話，擊打他們，使他們眼目昏迷。<br>And when the  Syrians came down to him, Elisha prayed to Jehovah and said, Strike this nation with blindness. And He struck them with blindness according to Elisha's word.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>6:19</a></td><td class=td>以利沙對他們說，這不是那條路，也不是那座城；你們跟我去，我必領你們到所尋找的人那裏。於是領他們到了撒瑪利亞。<br>Then Elisha said to them, This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek. And he brought them to Samaria.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>6:20</a></td><td class=td>他們進了撒瑪利亞，以利沙禱告說，耶和華阿，求你開這些人的眼目，使他們能看見。耶和華開他們的眼目，他們就看見了，不料，是在撒瑪利亞的城中。<br>And when they came to Samaria, Elisha said, O Jehovah, open the eyes of these men that they may see. And Jehovah opened their eyes and they saw that they were in the midst of Samaria.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>6:21</a></td><td class=td>以色列王見了他們，就問以利沙說，我父阿，我可以擊殺他們麼？我可以擊殺他們麼？<br>And when he saw them, the king of Israel said to Elisha, Shall I strike them? Shall I strike them, my father?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>6:22</a></td><td class=td>以利沙說，不可擊殺他們。你用刀用弓擄來的，你豈會擊殺他們麼？當在他們麵前設擺飲食，使他們吃喝，然後回到他們的主人那裏。<br>And he said, You shall not strike them. Would you strike those whom you have taken captive by your sword and your bow? Set bread and water before them, and let them eat and drink and go back to their master.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>6:23</a></td><td class=td>王就為他們豫備了盛大的筵席；他們吃喝完了，王打發他們離去，他們就回到自己主人那裏。從此，亞蘭人不再結隊侵犯以色列地了。<br>Then he prepared a great feast for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Syria no longer came into the land of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>6:24</a></td><td class=td>此後，亞蘭王便哈達聚集他的全軍，上來圍困撒瑪利亞。<br>And after this Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army and went up and besieged Samaria.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>6:25</a></td><td class=td>於是撒瑪利亞有了大饑荒；城被圍困，以致一個驢頭賣八十舍客勒銀子，半升鴿子糞賣五舍客勒銀子。<br>And there was a great famine in Samaria; and they besieged it until the head of a donkey was sold for eighty pieces of silver and a fourth part of a kab of doves' dung was sold for five pieces of silver.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>6:26</a></td><td class=td>一日，以色列王在城上經過，有一個婦人向他呼叫說，我主我王阿，求你幫助。<br>And once, as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying,  Help me, my lord O king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>6:27</a></td><td class=td>王說，耶和華不幫助你，我從何處幫助你？是從禾場，或是從酒醡呢？<br>And he said, If Jehovah does not help you, from where shall I help you? From the threshing floor or the winepress?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>6:28</a></td><td class=td>王問婦人說，你有什麼事？她說，這婦人對我說，將你的兒子交出來，我們今日可以吃，明日可以吃我的兒子。<br>And the king said to her, What is your trouble? And she said, This woman said to me, Give up your son that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>6:29</a></td><td class=td>我們就煮了我的兒子吃了。次日我對她說，將你的兒子交出來，我們可以吃；她卻將她的兒子藏起來了。<br>So we boiled my son and ate him. And on the next day I said to her, Give up your son that we may eat him; but she hid her son.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>6:30</a></td><td class=td>王聽見婦人的話，就撕裂衣服；當時王在城上經過，百姓看見王貼身穿著麻衣。<br>And when the king heard the woman's words, he tore his clothes. And as he passed by upon the wall, the people could see that he had sackcloth upon his flesh underneath.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>6:31</a></td><td class=td>王說，我今日若讓沙法的兒子以利沙的頭仍留在他身上，願神重重的降罰與我。<br>And he said, God do so to me, and even more, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>6:32</a></td><td class=td>那時，以利沙正坐在家中，長老們也與他同坐。王從他麵前伺候的人中打發一個人去；使者還沒有到，以利沙就對長老們說，你們有沒有看見這凶手之子，打發人來取我的頭？你們看著使者來到，就關上門，用門將他推出去。在他後頭不是有他主人腳步的響聲麼？<br>Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the king had sent a man from before him. Before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, Do you see that this son of a murderer has sent someone to take away my head? When the messenger comes, see that you shut the door and  hold the door closed against him. Surely the sound of his master's feet is behind him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>6:33</a></td><td class=td>以利沙還與他們說話的時候，使者下到他那裏，王也到了，說，這災禍是從耶和華那裏來的，我何必再仰望耶和華呢？<br>While he was still talking with them, the  king came down to him and said, This evil is from Jehovah; why should I wait for Jehovah any longer?</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
