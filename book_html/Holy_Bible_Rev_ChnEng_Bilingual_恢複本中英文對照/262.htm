<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>26:1</a></td><td class=td>西弗人到基比亞見掃羅，說，大衛不是在荒野前的哈基拉山藏著麼？<br>And the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, David is hiding himself on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite the desert!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>26:2</a></td><td class=td>掃羅就起身，帶領以色列的三千精兵，下到西弗的曠野，要在那裏尋索大衛。<br>And Saul rose up and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, with him three thousand choice men of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>26:3</a></td><td class=td>掃羅在荒野前的哈基拉山，在路旁安營。大衛住在曠野，聽說掃羅跟著他來到曠野，<br>And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite the desert, by the road. And David remained in the wilderness, but he saw that Saul had come into the wilderness after him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>26:4</a></td><td class=td>就打發人去探聽，便知道掃羅果然來到。<br>And David sent spies and knew for certain that Saul had come.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>26:5</a></td><td class=td>大衛起來，到掃羅安營的地方，察看掃羅和他的元帥尼珥的兒子押尼珥躺臥之處；掃羅睡在輜重營裏，百姓安營在他周圍。<br>So David rose up and went to the place where Saul encamped. And David looked on the place where Saul and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army, lay. Now Saul was lying within the entrenchment, and the people were encamped around him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>26:6</a></td><td class=td>大衛對赫人亞希米勒和洗魯雅的兒子約押的兄弟亞比篩說，誰同我下到營裏，到掃羅那裏去？亞比篩說，我同你下去。<br>And David responded and spoke to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai the son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul at the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>26:7</a></td><td class=td>於是大衛和亞比篩夜間到了百姓那裏，見掃羅睡臥在輜重營裏；他的槍在頭旁，插在地上。押尼珥和百姓躺臥在他周圍。<br>So David and Abishai went to the people by night; and there lay Saul, sleeping within the entrenchment, and his spear was stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and the people lay around him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>26:8</a></td><td class=td>亞比篩對大衛說，今日神將你的仇敵交在你手裏了，現在求你讓我拿槍將他刺透在地，一刺就成，不用再刺。<br>And Abishai said to David. God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore let me strike him with the spear even to the ground with one stroke, and I will not do it twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>26:9</a></td><td class=td>大衛對亞比篩說，不可殺害他；有誰伸手害耶和華的受膏者而無罪呢？<br>But David said to Abishai, Do not destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against Jehovah's anointed and be guiltless?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>26:10</a></td><td class=td>大衛又說，我指著永活的耶和華起誓，他或是被耶和華擊打，或是他的日子到了而死，或是下到戰場陣亡；<br>And David said, As Jehovah lives, Jehovah will strike him down, or his day will come to die, or he will go down in battle and perish.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>26:11</a></td><td class=td>我在耶和華麵前，萬不敢伸手害耶和華的受膏者。現在你可以將他頭旁的槍和水瓶拿來，我們就走。<br>Jehovah forbid that I should stretch out my hand against Jehovah's anointed. Now therefore take the spear that is by his head and the water jug, and let us go.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>26:12</a></td><td class=td>大衛從掃羅的頭旁拿了槍和水瓶，二人就走了，沒有人看見，沒有人知道，也沒有人醒起，都睡著了，因為耶和華使他們沉沉的睡了。<br>So David took the spear and the water jug by Saul's head, and they went away. And no one saw  it or knew about  it, nor did anyone awake, for all of them were sleeping; for a deep sleep from Jehovah had fallen upon them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>26:13</a></td><td class=td>大衛過到那邊去，遠遠的站在山頂上，與他們相離甚遠。<br>And David crossed over to the other side and stood on the top of the hill far off; a great distance was between them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>26:14</a></td><td class=td>大衛呼叫百姓和尼珥的兒子押尼珥，說，押尼珥阿，你不回答麼？押尼珥回答說，你是誰，竟呼叫王呢？<br>And David called out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Will you not answer, Abner? And Abner answered and said, Who are you that calls out to the king?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>26:15</a></td><td class=td>大衛對押尼珥說，你不是個大丈夫麼？以色列中誰能比你呢？民中有一人進來要殺害王你的主，你為何沒有保護王你的主呢？<br>And David said to Abner, Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>26:16</a></td><td class=td>你所作的這事是不好的。我指著永活的耶和華起誓，你們都是該死的；因為沒有保護你們的主，就是耶和華的受膏者。現在你看看王頭旁的槍和水瓶在那裏。<br>This thing is not good that you have done. As Jehovah lives, you are as good as dead because you did not guard your lord, Jehovah's anointed. Now therefore, see where the king's spear and the water jug that were by his head are.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>26:17</a></td><td class=td>掃羅聽出是大衛的聲音，就說，我兒大衛，這是你的聲音麼？大衛說，我主我王阿，是我的聲音；<br>And Saul recognized David's voice; and he said, Is this your voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>26:18</a></td><td class=td>又說，我主為什麼竟追趕仆人呢？我作了什麼？我手裏有什麼惡事？<br>And he said, Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>26:19</a></td><td class=td>現在求我主我王聽仆人的話：若是耶和華激動你攻擊我，願耶和華收納祭物；若是人激動你，願他們在耶和華麵前受咒詛；因為他們今日趕逐我，不容我在耶和華的產業上有分，說，你去事奉別神罷。<br>Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is Jehovah who has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering; but if it is the sons of men, let them be cursed before Jehovah; for they have driven me out today, so that I cannot share in Jehovah's inheritance, saying, Go, serve other gods.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>26:20</a></td><td class=td>現在求王不要使我的血流在離開耶和華之麵的地；以色列王出來是尋找一隻虼蚤，如同人在山上獵取鷓鴣一般。<br>Now therefore do not let my blood fall to the ground apart from the presence of Jehovah; for the king of Israel has come forth to seek a single flea, as one might hunt a partridge in the mountains.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>26:21</a></td><td class=td>掃羅說，我有罪了。我兒大衛，你回來罷，因你今日看我的性命為寶貴，我必不再加害你。我作了糊塗事，大大錯了。<br>And Saul said, I have sinned. Return, my son David; for I will not harm you anymore, because my life was precious in your sight this day. I have indeed acted foolishly and have made a very great mistake.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>26:22</a></td><td class=td>大衛回答說，王阿，你的槍在這裏，可以吩咐一個少年人過來拿去<br>And David answered and said, Here is the spear, O king. Let one of the young men cross over and get it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>26:23</a></td><td class=td>耶和華必照各人的公義忠實報應他：今日耶和華將你交在我手裏，我卻不肯伸手害耶和華的受膏者；<br>And Jehovah will repay to each man his righteousness and faithfulness: Because Jehovah has delivered you into my hand today, and I would not stretch out my hand against Jehovah's anointed;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>26:24</a></td><td class=td>看哪，我今日怎樣重看你的性命，願耶和華也照樣重看我的性命，拯救我脫離一切患難。<br>Then just as great as your life was in my eyes this day, so great may my life be in Jehovah's eyes that He would deliver me from all distress.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>26:25</a></td><td class=td>掃羅對大衛說，我兒大衛，願你得福。你必有作為，也必得勝。於是大衛繼續走他的路，掃羅也回他的本處去了。<br>And Saul said to David, Blessed are you, my son David. You shall most certainly both do and prevail. And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
