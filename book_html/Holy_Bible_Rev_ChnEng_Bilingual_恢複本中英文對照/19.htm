<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>19:2</a></td><td class=td>說，我主阿，請你們轉來仆人家裏洗洗腳，過一夜，清早起來再上路。他們說，不，我們要在大街上過夜。<br>And he said, Now, my lords, please turn aside here to your servant's house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you can rise up early and go on your way. But they said, No; we will spend the night in the square.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>19:3</a></td><td class=td>羅得切切的請他們，他們才轉身進到他屋裏。羅得為他們豫備筵席，烤無酵餅，他們就吃了。<br>But he urged them strongly, and they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>19:4</a></td><td class=td>他們還沒有躺下，所多瑪城裏各處的人，連老帶少，都來圍住那房子，<br>But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>19:13</a></td><td class=td>我們就要毀滅這地方；因為他們罪惡的聲音在耶和華麵前甚大，耶和華差我們來，要毀滅這地方。<br>For we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has become so great before Jehovah that Jehovah has sent us to destroy it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>19:14</a></td><td class=td>羅得就出去，告訴要娶他女兒的女婿們說，你們起來離開這地方，因為耶和華要毀滅這城。他女婿們卻以為他在說戲言。<br>And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, Rise up; go forth from this place, for Jehovah will destroy the city.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>19:16</a></td><td class=td>但羅得遲延不走。那兩個人因為耶和華憐憫羅得，就抓著他的手和他妻子的手，並他兩個女兒的手，把他們領出來，安置在城外；<br>But he lingered; so the men seized his hand and the hand of his wife and the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>19:17</a></td><td class=td>領他們出來以後，就說，逃命罷！不可回頭看，也不可在平原上任何一處站住。要往山上逃跑，免得你被剿滅。<br>And when they had brought them outside, He said, Escape for your life.

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>19:21</a></td><td class=td>天使對他說，這事我也應允你；我不傾覆你所說的這城。<br>And He said to him, I now grant you this request also, that I will not overthrow the city concerning which you have spoken.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>19:22</a></td><td class=td>你要快快逃到那裏；因為你還沒有到那裏，我不能作什麼。因此那城名叫瑣珥。<br>Hurry, escape there; for I cannot do anything until you arrive there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>19:23</a></td><td class=td>羅得到了瑣珥，日頭已經升起，照在地上。<br>The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar.</td></tr>
