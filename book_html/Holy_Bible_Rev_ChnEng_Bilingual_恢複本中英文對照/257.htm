<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>21:1</a></td><td class=td>大衛往挪伯去，到了祭司亞希米勒那裏；亞希米勒戰戰兢兢的出來迎接他，對他說，你為什麼獨自來，沒有人跟隨呢？<br>And David went to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech came trembling to meet David and said to him, Why are you alone, and no one with you?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>21:2</a></td><td class=td>大衛對祭司亞希米勒說，王吩咐我一件事，說，我差遣你、吩咐你的這件事，不要使人知道。故此我已派定少年人在某處等候我。<br>And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has charged me with some matter, and he said to me, Let no man know anything about the matter that I have sent you on and charged you with. So I have made an appointment with my young men at such and such a place.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>21:3</a></td><td class=td>現在你手下有什麼？求你給我五個餅，或是別樣找得著的食物。<br>Now then what do you have on hand? Give five loaves of bread into my hand, or whatever there is to be found.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>21:4</a></td><td class=td>祭司回答大衛說，我手下沒有平常的餅，隻有聖餅；若少年人沒有親近婦人，才可以吃。<br>And the priest answered David and said, There is no common bread on hand; yet there is holy bread, but only if the young men have kept themselves from women.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>21:5</a></td><td class=td>大衛回答祭司說，我們實在沒有親近婦人，我出征的時候，素來如此；即使是平常行路，少年人的器皿還是聖別的；何況今日，他們的器皿更是聖別的！<br>And David answered the priest and said to him, Women have indeed been kept from us, as previously when I went forth; and the vessels of the young men were holy, even if it was a common journey. How much more then today will their vessels be holy!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>21:6</a></td><td class=td>祭司就拿聖餅給他；因為在那裏沒有別的餅，隻有陳設餅，是當時為了放上熱的餅，從耶和華麵前撤下來的。<br>So the priest gave him what was holy, for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence, which was taken from before Jehovah, to be replaced by hot bread at the time it was taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>21:7</a></td><td class=td>當日有掃羅的一個臣仆在那裏，留在耶和華麵前。他名叫多益，是以東人，作掃羅的司牧長。<br>Now one of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before Jehovah. His name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of the shepherds that belonged to Saul.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>21:8</a></td><td class=td>大衛對亞希米勒說，你手下這裏有槍有刀沒有？因為王的事甚急，我手裏連刀劍器械都沒有帶。<br>And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not a spear or a sword here on hand? For I have brought neither my sword nor my equipment with me, for the king's matter was urgent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>21:9</a></td><td class=td>祭司說，你在以拉穀所打死的非利士人歌利亞，他的刀在這裏，裹在布中，放在以弗得後邊，你若要拿去給自己用，就拿去罷；除此以外，這裏再沒有別的。大衛說，這刀沒有可比的；你給我罷。<br>And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the valley of Elah, is here, wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take it, take  it; for there is no other here but that one. And David said, There is none like it; give it to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>21:10</a></td><td class=td>那日大衛起來，從掃羅麵前逃走，來到迦特王亞吉那裏。<br>Then David rose up and fled that day from before Saul, and he went to Achish the king of Gath.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>21:11</a></td><td class=td>亞吉的臣仆對亞吉說，這不是以色列地的王大衛麼？那裏的婦女跳舞唱和，不是指著他說，掃羅殺死千千，大衛殺死萬萬麼？<br>But the servants of Achish said to him, Is this not David the king of the land? Is this not him of whom they sang to one another in dances, saying, Saul has struck down his thousands; But David, his ten thousands?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>21:12</a></td><td class=td>大衛將這些話放在心裏，甚是懼怕迦特王亞吉，<br>And David took these words to heart and feared Achish the king of Gath greatly.</td></tr>
