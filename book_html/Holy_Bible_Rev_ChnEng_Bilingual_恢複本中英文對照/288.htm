<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>21:1</a></td><td class=td>大衛在位的日子有饑荒，一連三年，大衛就求問耶和華。耶和華說，這是因著掃羅，因著他的家流了人的血，因為他曾殺死基遍人。<br>And there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David inquired of Jehovah. And Jehovah said, It is because of Saul and because of  his house of bloodshed, for he put those Gibeonites to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>21:2</a></td><td class=td>原來這基遍人不是以色列人，乃是亞摩利人中所剩的；以色列人曾向他們起誓，不殺滅他們，掃羅卻為以色列人和猶大人發熱心，想要殺滅他們。大衛王召了基遍人來，<br>So the king called for the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel but were of the remnant of the Amorites, and the children of Israel had sworn to them. But Saul had sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>21:3</a></td><td class=td>對他們說，我當為你們怎樣行？可用什麼遮罪，使你們為耶和華的產業祝福？<br>And David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? And how shall I make expiation that you may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>21:4</a></td><td class=td>基遍人對他說，我們和掃羅與他家的事並不關乎金銀，我們也不願以色列中有一個人被處死。大衛說，你們怎樣說，我就為你們怎樣行。<br>And the Gibeonites said to him, It is not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul and his house, and it is not for us to put any man to death in Israel. And he said, Whatever you say I will do for you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>21:5</a></td><td class=td>他們對王說，那從前毀壞我們，謀害我們，要滅絕我們，使我們不得在以色列全境內立足的人，<br>Then they said to the king, The man who consumed us and who made plans against us to destroy us so that we would not remain within any of the territory of Israel,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>21:6</a></td><td class=td>請將他子孫中的七人交給我們，我們要在耶和華麵前，將他們懸掛在耶和華所揀選之掃羅的基比亞。王說，我必交給你們。<br>Let seven men from among his sons be given to us, and we will hang them unto Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Jehovah. And the king said, I will give  them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>21:7</a></td><td class=td>王因為自己與掃羅的兒子約拿單之間，曾有指著耶和華所起的誓，就愛惜掃羅的孫子，約拿單的兒子米非波設，不交出來，<br>But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath of Jehovah that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>21:8</a></td><td class=td>卻把愛雅的女兒利斯巴給掃羅所生的兩個兒子亞摩尼和米非波設，以及掃羅女兒米拉給米何拉人巴西萊兒子亞得列所生的五個兒子，<br>So the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>21:9</a></td><td class=td>交在基遍人的手裏。基遍人就把他們，在耶和華麵前懸掛在山上，這七人就一同死亡。他們被處死的時候，正是收割日子的起頭，就是動手割大麥的時候。<br>And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites. And they hanged them on the mountain before Jehovah, and the seven perished together. And they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of the barley harvest.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>21:10</a></td><td class=td>愛雅的女兒利斯巴用麻布為自己鋪在磐石上，從動手收割的時候，直到天降雨在屍身上的時候，日間不容空中的飛鳥落在屍身上，夜間不讓田野的走獸前來蹧踐。<br>And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it on a rock for herself, from the beginning of harvest until rain from heaven fell on their bodies; and she did not allow the birds of heaven to come upon them by day or the beasts of the field by night.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>21:11</a></td><td class=td>有人將掃羅的妃嬪愛雅女兒利斯巴所行的這事告訴大衛。<br>And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>21:12</a></td><td class=td>大衛就去，從基列雅比居民那裏，將掃羅的骸骨和他兒子約拿單的骸骨搬了來；原來非利士人從前在基利波殺掃羅，將屍身懸掛在伯珊的街市上，基列雅比居民把屍身從那裏偷了去。<br>And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the open square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them on the day when the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>21:13</a></td><td class=td>大衛將掃羅的骸骨和他兒子約拿單的骸骨，從那裏搬上去；眾人把被懸掛七人的骸骨收殮了，<br>So he brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there, and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>21:14</a></td><td class=td>將掃羅和他兒子約拿單的骸骨葬在便雅憫地的洗拉，在掃羅父親基士的墳墓裏；他們行了王所吩咐的。此後神應允國民為那地所懇求的。<br>And they buried the bones of Saul and of Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin in Zela, in the grave of Kish his father; and they did all that the king had commanded. And God responded to the entreaty for the land after that.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>21:15</a></td><td class=td>非利士人又與以色列人打仗；大衛帶著仆人下去，與非利士人接戰，大衛就疲乏了。<br>And again the Philistines were at war with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought with the Philistines. And David became faint.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>21:16</a></td><td class=td>有巨人的後代以實比諾，他的槍是銅的，重三百舍客勒，又佩著新刀；他想要殺大衛。<br>And Ishbi-benob, who was  one of the children of the giant and whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass, was girded with new weapons; and he intended to slay David.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>21:17</a></td><td class=td>但洗魯雅的兒子亞比篩幫助大衛，擊打那非利士人，將他殺死。那時，跟隨大衛的人向大衛起誓說，以後你不可再與我們一同出戰，免得你使以色列的燈熄滅了。<br>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him and struck down the Philistine and killed him. Then David's men swore to him, saying, You shall not go forth with us again into battle, lest you quench the lamp of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>21:18</a></td><td class=td>後來，以色列人又在歌伯與非利士人打仗；戶沙人西比該殺了巨人的一個後代撒弗。<br>Then after this there was war again with the Philistines at Gob; and Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was  one of the children of the giant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>21:19</a></td><td class=td>以後在歌伯又與非利士人打仗；伯利恒人雅雷俄珥金的兒子伊勒哈難殺了迦特人歌利亞，這人的槍杆粗如織布的機軸。<br>And there was war with the Philistines, again at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, the Bethlehemite, slew Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>21:20</a></td><td class=td>又在迦特打仗，那裏有一個身量高大的人，手腳都是六指，共有二十四個指頭；他也是巨人所生的。<br>And again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also had been born to the giant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>21:21</a></td><td class=td>這人向以色列人罵陣，大衛的哥哥示米亞的兒子約拿單就殺了他。<br>And he defied Israel; and Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, slew him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>21:22</a></td><td class=td>這四個人是在迦特的巨人所生的，他們都死在大衛和他仆人的手下。<br>These four had been born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hands of his servants.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
