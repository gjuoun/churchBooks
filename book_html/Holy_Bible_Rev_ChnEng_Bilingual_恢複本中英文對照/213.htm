And He said, I caused you to go up out from Egypt, and I brought you into the land that I swore to your fathers. And I said, I will never break My covenant with you,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>你們也不可與這地的居民立約，要拆毀他們的祭壇。你們竟沒有聽從我的話。你們這作的是什麼事？<br>And you shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars. But you did not listen to My voice. What is this that you have done?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>因此我又說，我必不將他們從你們麵前趕出；他們必作你們肋下的荊棘；他們的神必作你們的網羅。<br>Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they will be like thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>耶和華的使者向以色列眾人說這話的時候，百姓就放聲而哭。<br>And when the Angel of Jehovah had spoken these words to all the children of Israel, the people lifted up their voice and wept.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>於是給那地方起名叫波金。眾人在那裏向耶和華獻祭。<br>And they called the name of that place Bochim. And they offered to Jehovah there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>從前約書亞打發百姓去的時候，以色列人各歸自己的地業，占據那地。<br>Now when Joshua sent the people away, each of the children of Israel went to his own inheritance to possess the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>約書亞在世的日子，以及約書亞死後，那些見過耶和華為以色列人所行大事的長老還在的日子，百姓都事奉耶和華。<br>And the people served Jehovah throughout all the days of Joshua and throughout all the days of the elders whose days extended after Joshua's and who saw all the great work of Jehovah that He had done for Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>耶和華的仆人嫩的兒子約書亞，正一百一十歲就死了。<br>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died at the age of one hundred and ten years.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>那一代的人也都歸了自己的列祖；在他們之後，有另一代的人興起，不認識耶和華，也不知道耶和華為以色列人所行的事。<br>And all that generation as well were gathered to their fathers; and another generation, who did not know Jehovah or the work that He had done for Israel, rose up after them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>以色列人行耶和華眼中看為惡的事，去事奉諸巴力，<br>And the children of Israel did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah and served the Baals.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>離棄了領他們出埃及地的耶和華他們列祖的神，去隨從跪拜別神，就是四圍眾民的一些神，惹耶和華發怒；<br>And they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them out from the land of Egypt; and they followed after other gods from among the gods of the peoples who surrounded them; and they worshipped them and provoked Jehovah to anger.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>並離棄耶和華，去事奉巴力和亞斯他錄。<br>And they forsook Jehovah and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>耶和華的怒氣向以色列人發作，把他們交在搶奪者手中，這些人就搶奪他們；祂又將他們交付在四圍仇敵的手中，甚至他們在仇敵麵前再不能站立得住。<br>Then the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of plunderers; and they plundered them. And He sold them into the hand of their enemies around them, and they were no longer able to stand before their enemies.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>他們無論往何處去，耶和華的手都以災禍攻擊他們，正如耶和華所說的，又如耶和華向他們所起誓的；他們便極其困苦。<br>Whenever they went out, the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had spoken and as Jehovah had sworn to them; and they were greatly distressed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>耶和華興起士師，士師就拯救他們脫離搶奪他們之人的手。<br>And Jehovah raised up judges, and they saved them out of the hands of those who plundered them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>但他們也不聽從士師，竟隨從別神，行了邪淫，向這些神跪拜，速速的偏離他們列祖所行的道路，不像他們列祖那樣聽從耶和華的命令。<br>Yet they did not listen to their judges either, but they went about as harlots after other gods and worshipped them. They turned aside quickly from the way in which their fathers walked, the way of obeying the commandments of Jehovah; this they did not do.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>耶和華為他們興起士師，就與那士師同在。那士師在世的一切日子，耶和華拯救他們脫離仇敵的手；他們因受人壓迫欺淩，就哀聲歎氣，耶和華便憐恤他們。<br>And when Jehovah raised up judges for them, Jehovah was with the judge, and He saved them from the hand of their enemies throughout all the days of the judge; for Jehovah would be moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed them and crushed them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>及至那士師死後，他們就轉去行惡，比他們列祖更甚，去隨從別神，事奉跪拜這些神，總不斷絕他們的惡行，和頑梗的行徑。<br>But when the judge died, they turned and acted more corruptly than their fathers by following after other gods in order to serve them and worship them; they did not cease from any of their practices or from their stubborn way.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>2:20</a></td><td class=td>於是耶和華的怒氣向以色列人發作；祂說，因這民違背我所吩咐他們列祖遵守的約，不聽從我的話，<br>And the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel; and He said, Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers and they do not listen to My voice,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>2:21</a></td><td class=td>所以約書亞死的時候所剩下的各族，我也必不再從他們麵前趕出，<br>I for My part will no longer dispossess from before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>2:22</a></td><td class=td>為要藉著這剩下的各族，試驗以色列人，看他們肯不肯謹守遵行我的道路，像他們列祖謹守遵行一樣。<br>In order to test Israel through them as to whether or not they will keep the way of Jehovah by walking in  it, as their fathers kept it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>2:23</a></td><td class=td>這樣，耶和華留下各族，不將他們速速趕出，也沒有交在約書亞的手中。<br>So Jehovah left these nations, not dispossessing them quickly, and did not deliver them into the hand of Joshua.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
