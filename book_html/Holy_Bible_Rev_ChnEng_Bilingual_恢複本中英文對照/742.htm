This One who is majestic in His apparel, Marching in the greatness of His strength? It is I who speak in righteousness, Mighty to save.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>63:2</a></td><td class=td>你的裝扮為何有紅色，你的衣服為何像踹酒醡的呢？<br>Why are you red in apparel, And your garments like those of him who treads in the  winepress?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>63:3</a></td><td class=td>我獨自踹酒醡，眾民中無一人與我同在。我在怒中將他們踹下，在烈怒中將他們踐踏；他們的血濺在我衣服上，並且我染汙了我一切的衣裳。<br>I have trodden the wine trough  alone, And from the peoples there was no man with Me. And I trod them in My anger And trampled them in My wrath; And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments, And I have stained all My apparel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>63:4</a></td><td class=td>因為報仇之日在我心中，我救贖之年已經來到。<br>For the day of recompense was in My heart, And the year of My redemption had come.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>63:5</a></td><td class=td>我觀看，見無人幫助；我詫異無人扶持；所以我自己的膀臂為我施行拯救，我的烈怒將我扶持。<br>And I looked and there was no one to help; And I was appalled that there was no one to uphold. Therefore My own arm accomplished salvation for Me, And My wrath, it upheld Me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>63:6</a></td><td class=td>我在怒中踹下眾民，在烈怒中使他們沉醉，又將他們的血倒在地上。<br>And I trod down the peoples in My anger And made them drunk in My wrath, And I poured out their lifeblood upon the earth.</td></tr>

Where is He who put  in their midst His Spirit of holiness;</td></tr>

Return for the sake of Your servants, The tribes of Your inheritance.</td></tr>
