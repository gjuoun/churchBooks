<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>5:6</a></td><td class=td>以色列人在曠野走了四十年，直到國民，就是出埃及的兵丁，盡都消滅了，因為他們沒有聽從耶和華的話；耶和華曾向他們起誓，必不容他們看見耶和華向他們列祖起誓要賜給我們的地，就是流奶與蜜之地。<br>For the children of Israel went for forty years through the wilderness until all the nation, the men of war who had come out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not listen to the voice of Jehovah, they to whom Jehovah swore that they would not see the land that Jehovah had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>5:7</a></td><td class=td>他們的子孫，就是耶和華所興起來接替他們的，約書亞給他們行了割禮；他們本沒有受過割禮，因為在路上沒有給他們行割禮。<br>And their children, whom He had raised up in place of them, these Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>5:12</a></td><td class=td>他們吃了那地的出產，當日嗎哪就止住了，以色列人也不再有嗎哪了；那一年，他們卻吃迦南地的出產。<br>And the manna ceased on that day, when they ate of the produce of the land; and there was no longer manna for the children of Israel, but they ate of the yield of the land of Canaan that year.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>5:13</a></td><td class=td>約書亞靠近耶利哥的時候，舉目觀看；看哪，有一個人手裏有拔出來的刀，對麵站立。約書亞到他那裏，對他說，你是幫助我們呢，還是幫助我們的敵人？<br>Now once, when Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked; and behold, there was a man standing opposite him, and His sword was drawn in His hand.

Then Joshua fell to the ground upon his face and worshipped. And he said to Him, What does my Lord speak to His servant?</td></tr>
