<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>13:1</a></td><td class=td>此後發生了一件事：大衛的兒子押沙龍有一個美麗的妹妹，名叫他瑪；大衛的兒子暗嫩愛上了她。<br>And some time after this, it so happened that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>13:2</a></td><td class=td>暗嫩為他妹妹他瑪憂急成病；因為他瑪還是處女，暗嫩眼看難以向她行事。<br>And Amnon was so distraught that he made himself sick because of Tamar his sister; for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>13:3</a></td><td class=td>暗嫩有一個朋友，名叫約拿達，是大衛哥哥示米亞的兒子。這約拿達為人極其狡猾；<br>Now Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very crafty man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>13:4</a></td><td class=td>他問暗嫩說，王的兒子阿，你為何一天比一天瘦弱呢？你不能告訴我麼？暗嫩對他說，我愛上了我兄弟押沙龍的妹妹他瑪。<br>And he said to him, Why are you, O son of the king, so downcast morning after morning? Will you not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>13:5</a></td><td class=td>約拿達說，你躺在床上裝病；你父親來看你，就對他說，請叫我妹妹他瑪來，把食物遞給我吃；叫她在我眼前豫備食物，使我看見，好從她手裏接過來吃。<br>And Jonadab said to him, Lie down on your bed, and pretend to be sick; and when your father comes to see you, tell him, Please let Tamar my sister come and give me bread to eat, and let her make  me food in my sight that I may see it and eat from her hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>13:6</a></td><td class=td>於是暗嫩躺臥裝病。王來看他，他對王說，請叫我妹妹他瑪來，在我眼前作兩個餅，我好從她手裏接過來吃。<br>So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let Tamar my sister come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat  them from her hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>13:7</a></td><td class=td>大衛就打發人到宮裏，對他瑪說，你往你哥哥暗嫩的屋裏去，為他豫備食物。<br>Then David sent  word home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and make him food.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>13:8</a></td><td class=td>他瑪就到她哥哥暗嫩的屋裏；暗嫩正躺臥。他瑪把麵拿來摶好，在他眼前作餅，且烤熟了。<br>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was lying down. And she took dough and kneaded  it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>13:9</a></td><td class=td>她把鍋拿來，在他麵前將餅從鍋裏倒出來，他卻不肯吃，說，叫眾人離開我出去罷！眾人就都離開他，出去了。<br>And she took the pan and emptied  it before him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said, Have all the men go out from me. And all the men went out from him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>13:10</a></td><td class=td>暗嫩對他瑪說，你把食物拿進內室，我好從你手裏接過來吃。他瑪就把所作的餅拿來，送到內室她哥哥暗嫩那裏，<br>And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into  my room so that I may eat from your hand. And Tamar took the cakes that she had made and brought  them to Amnon her brother in  his room.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>13:11</a></td><td class=td>拿著餅上前給他吃，他便拉住他瑪，說，我妹妹，你來與我同寢。<br>And when she brought  them near to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, Come lie with me, my sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>13:12</a></td><td class=td>他瑪說，我哥哥，不可這樣，不要玷辱我。以色列中不當這樣行，你不要作這愚妄的事。<br>And she said to him, No, my brother. Do not force me, for such a thing should not be done in Israel. Do not commit this folly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>13:13</a></td><td class=td>你玷辱了我，我要將我的羞恥帶往那裏去呢？至於你，你在以色列中也必成了愚妄人。現在請你向王題說，他必不禁止我歸你。<br>And where will I carry my shame? And you, you will be like one of the foolish men in Israel. Now therefore, speak to the king, I beg you; for he will not withhold me from you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>13:14</a></td><td class=td>但暗嫩不肯聽她的話，因比她力大，就玷辱她，與她同寢。<br>But he would not listen to her voice. And being stronger than she, he forced her and lay with her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>13:15</a></td><td class=td>隨後，暗嫩極其恨她，那恨她的恨比先前愛她的愛更甚。暗嫩對她說，你起來，去罷。<br>Then Amnon hated her with a very great hatred, for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Rise up  and go.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>13:16</a></td><td class=td>他瑪對他說，不要這樣，你趕我出去，這惡比你先前對我所行的更大。但暗嫩不肯聽她的話，<br>But she said to him, Do not cause this greater wrong by sending me away,  greater than the other that you have done to me. But he would not listen to her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>13:17</a></td><td class=td>就叫伺候自己的僮仆來，說，將這個女子從我這裏趕出去，隨後就關門上閂。<br>And he called his young man who served him and said, Send this woman away from me outside, and bolt the door behind her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>13:18</a></td><td class=td>那時他瑪穿著長袖衣服，因為沒有出嫁的公主都是穿這樣的外袍。暗嫩的仆人就把她領出去，隨後關門上閂。<br>Now she had a long garment with sleeves, for the virgin daughters of the king dressed themselves in such robes. So his servant brought her outside and bolted the door behind her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>13:19</a></td><td class=td>他瑪把灰撒在頭上，撕裂所穿的長袖衣服，以手抱頭，一麵行走，一麵哭喊。<br>And Tamar put ashes upon her head and rent the long garment with sleeves that was upon her, and she put her hand on her head and went off, crying aloud as she went.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>13:20</a></td><td class=td>她胞兄押沙龍問她說，莫非你哥哥暗嫩與你親近了麼？我妹妹，暫且不要作聲，他是你的哥哥，不要將這事放在心上。他瑪就孤孤單單的住在她胞兄押沙龍家裏。<br>Then Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? But be quiet now, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this thing to heart. And Tamar remained in her brother Absalom's house, desolate.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>13:21</a></td><td class=td>大衛王聽見這一切事，就甚發怒。<br>And when King David heard about all these things, he was very angry.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>13:22</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍並不和他哥哥暗嫩說好說歹；因為暗嫩玷辱他妹妹他瑪，所以押沙龍恨惡他。<br>But Absalom did not speak anything good or evil to Amnon, for Absalom hated Amnon because he had forced Tamar his sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>13:23</a></td><td class=td>過了二年，在靠近以法蓮的巴力夏瑣，有人為押沙龍剪羊毛；押沙龍請王的眾子與他同去。<br>Then after two full years, while Absalom had sheep shearers in Baal-hazor, which is by Ephraim, Absalom invited all the king's sons.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>13:24</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍來見王，說，現在有人為仆人剪羊毛，請王和王的臣仆與仆人同去。<br>And Absalom came to the king and said, Your servant now has sheep shearers. May the king and his servants go now with your servant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>13:25</a></td><td class=td>王對押沙龍說，不必，我兒，我們不必都去，免得你負擔太重。押沙龍懇切請王，王仍是不肯去，隻是為他祝福。<br>But the king said to Absalom, No, my son; let us not all go, or we will be a burden to you. And he pressed him, but he would not go; yet he gave him his blessing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>13:26</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍說，王若不去，請讓我哥哥暗嫩與我們同去。王說，何必要他與你同去呢？<br>Then Absalom said, If not, then let Amnon my brother go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with you?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>13:27</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍懇切求王，王就派暗嫩和王的眾子與他同去。<br>But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>13:28</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍吩咐仆人說，你們注意，看暗嫩飲酒，心裏高興的時候，我對你們說，殺暗嫩，你們便殺他，不要懼怕。這不是我吩咐你們的麼？你們隻管剛強奮勇。<br>And Absalom commanded his attendants, saying, Watch now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I say to you, Strike Amnon, then kill him. Do not be afraid; is it not I who have commanded you? Be strong and valiant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>13:29</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍的仆人就照押沙龍所吩咐的，向暗嫩行了。王的眾子都起來，各人騎上騾子，逃跑了。<br>And Absalom's attendants did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. And all the king's sons rose up, and each mounted his mule and fled.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>13:30</a></td><td class=td>他們還在路上，有風聲傳到大衛那裏，說，押沙龍將王的眾子都擊殺了，沒有留下一個。<br>And while they were on the way, the report came to David, namely, Absalom has struck down all the king's sons, and not one of them is left.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>13:31</a></td><td class=td>王就起來，撕裂自己的衣服，躺在地上；王的臣仆也都撕裂衣服，站在旁邊。<br>And the king rose up and rent his garments and lay on the ground, and all his servants stood by with their garments rent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>13:32</a></td><td class=td>大衛哥哥示米亞的兒子約拿達回應說，我主，不要以為他們把王的眾子少年人都殺了，其實隻有暗嫩一個人死了。自從暗嫩玷辱押沙龍妹妹他瑪的那日，押沙龍就定意殺暗嫩了。<br>Then Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord think that all the young men, the sons of the king, have been killed, for Amnon alone is dead. For this has been determined by Absalom since the day Amnon forced Tamar his sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>13:33</a></td><td class=td>現在，我主我王，不要把這事放在心上，以為王的眾子都死了；其實隻有暗嫩一個人死了。<br>Now therefore let my lord the king not take the matter to heart, thinking that all the king's sons are dead; for only Amnon is dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>13:34</a></td><td class=td>押沙龍逃跑了。守望的少年人舉目觀看，見有許多人從後麵山邊的路而來。<br>But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and there  they were, a multitude of people coming from the road behind him at the side of the mountain.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>13:35</a></td><td class=td>約拿達對王說，看哪，王的眾子都來了，果然與你仆人所說的相合。<br>Then Jonadab said to the king, Here come the king's sons; as your servant has said, so has it been.</td></tr>
