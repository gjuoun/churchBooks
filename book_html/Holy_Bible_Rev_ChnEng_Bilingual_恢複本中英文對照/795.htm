Do not conceal it, but say, Babylon is captured; Bel is put to shame; Merodach is shattered; Her images are put to shame; Her idols are dismayed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>50:3</a></td><td class=td>因有一國從北方上來攻擊她，使她的地荒涼，無人居住；連人帶牲畜，都逃走了。<br>For a nation has come up against her from the north; It will make her land a waste, And there will be no inhabitant in it; Both man and beast have fled; they are gone away.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>50:4</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，當那些日子，那時候，以色列人要和猶大人同來，隨走隨哭，尋求耶和華他們的神。<br>In those days and at that time, declares Jehovah, The children of Israel will come, Both they and the children of Judah together; They will go along with weeping as they go, And they will seek Jehovah their God.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>50:6</a></td><td class=td>我的百姓成了迷失的羊；他們的牧人使他們走錯了路，使他們流落山上；他們從大山走到小山，竟忘了安歇之處。<br>My people are lost sheep; Their shepherds have led them astray; They have made them turn aside on the mountains; They have gone from mountain to hill; They have forgotten their resting place.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>50:7</a></td><td class=td>凡遇見他們的，就把他們吞滅；他們的敵人說，我們沒有罪，因為他們得罪了那作公義居所的耶和華，就是他們列祖所盼望的耶和華。<br>All who found them have devoured them, And their adversaries have said, We are not guilty, Because they have sinned against Jehovah, The habitation of righteousness, Even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers.</td></tr>

Their arrows will be like those of an expert mighty man; None will return empty-handed.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>50:12</a></td><td class=td>你們的母親巴比倫就極其抱愧，生你們的必然蒙羞；她被列在諸國之末，淪為曠野、旱地、沙漠。<br>Your mother has been greatly ashamed; She who bore you has become a reproach: Indeed, she has become the last of the nations, A wilderness, a dry land and a desert.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>50:13</a></td><td class=td>因耶和華的忿怒，她必無人居住，要全然荒涼；凡經過巴比倫的，都必驚駭，又嗤笑她一切的創傷。<br>Because of the wrath of Jehovah she will not be inhabited, But she will become a complete desolation; For every one who passes by Babylon will be astonished And will hiss at all her wounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>50:14</a></td><td class=td>所有拉弓的，你們要在巴比倫的四圍擺陣，射箭攻擊她；不要愛惜箭枝，因她得罪了耶和華。<br>Set yourselves in array against Babylon all around, All those who bend the bow; Shoot at her; spare no arrow; Because she has sinned against Jehovah;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>50:15</a></td><td class=td>你們要四圍呐喊攻擊她。她已經投降；她的外郭坍塌了，城牆拆毀了；因為這是耶和華報仇的事；你們要向巴比倫報仇，她怎樣待人，也要怎樣待她。<br>Raise a shout against her all around. She has surrendered; her buttresses have fallen, Her walls have been torn down; For this is the vengeance of Jehovah: Take vengeance on her; As she has done, so do to her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>50:16</a></td><td class=td>你們要將巴比倫撒種的和收割時拿鐮刀的，都剪除了；他們各人因怕欺壓者的刀劍，必歸回本族，逃到本土。<br>Cut off the sower from Babylon, And the one who handles a sickle in the time of harvest; Because of the sword of the  oppressor Each one will turn to his people, And each one flee to his own  land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>50:17</a></td><td class=td>以色列是打散的羊，獅子把他趕逐出去了。首先是亞述王將他吞滅，末後是巴比倫王尼布甲尼撒將他的骨頭啃斷。<br>Israel is a scattered sheep; Lions have driven him away. First the king of Assyria devoured him, and last this Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon has gnawed his bones.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>50:18</a></td><td class=td>所以萬軍之耶和華以色列的神如此說，我必懲罰巴比倫王和他的地，像我從前懲罰亞述王一樣。<br>Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I punished the king of Assyria.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>50:19</a></td><td class=td>我必再領以色列回他的居所；他必在迦密和巴珊得喂養，又在以法蓮山地和基列境內，魂得飽足。<br>And I will bring Israel back to his habitation, And he will feed on Carmel and Bashan, And in the hill country of Ephraim and in Gilead He will satisfy his soul.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>50:24</a></td><td class=td>巴比倫哪，我為你設下網羅，你被纏住卻不自知；你被尋著，也被捉住，因為你與耶和華爭戰。<br>I have set a snare for you, and you also have been taken captive, O Babylon, and you did not know; You were found, and you also were seized, Because you engaged in war with Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>50:25</a></td><td class=td>耶和華已經開了武庫，拿出祂惱恨的兵器，因為這是主萬軍之耶和華的工作，要攻擊迦勒底人之地。<br>Jehovah has opened His armory And has brought out the weapons of His wrath, For this is the work of the Lord Jehovah of hosts Against the land of the Chaldeans.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=26>50:26</a></td><td class=td>你們要從四圍來攻擊她，開她的倉廩，將她堆如高堆，毀滅淨盡，絲毫不留。<br>Come against her from every side; Open her granaries. Pile her up like heaps; Destroy her utterly; Let nothing of her remain.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>50:27</a></td><td class=td>要殺她的一切公牛，使他們下去遭宰殺。他們有禍了，因為他們的日子，就是向他們追討的時候，已經來到。<br>Slay all her oxen; Let them go down to slaughter. Woe to them, for their day has come, The time of their punishment.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>50:28</a></td><td class=td>有從巴比倫地逃跑脫身之人的聲音，在錫安報告耶和華我們的神報仇，就是為祂的殿報仇。<br>There is a sound of those who flee and escape From the land of Babylon, To declare in Zion The vengeance of Jehovah our God, The vengeance for His temple.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>50:29</a></td><td class=td>要招集弓箭手，一切拉弓的人，攻擊巴比倫；要在她四圍安營攻擊她；不要容一人逃脫。要照她所作的報應她；她怎樣待人，也要怎樣待她；因為她敵對耶和華以色列的聖者，舉動狂傲。<br>Summon archers against Babylon, All those who bend the bow. Encamp against her all around; Let there be no escape. Recompense her according to her work; According to all that she has done, so do to her. For she has acted proudly against Jehovah, Against the Holy One of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>50:30</a></td><td class=td>所以她的少年人，必仆倒在寬闊處；當那日，她一切的兵丁必默默無聲；這是耶和華說的。<br>Therefore her young men will fall in her open squares, And all her men of war will be silenced in that day, Declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>50:31</a></td><td class=td>主萬軍之耶和華說，你這狂傲的阿，我與你反對；因為你的日子，就是我向你追討的時候，已經來到。<br>Indeed, I am against you, O Pride, Declares the Lord Jehovah of hosts; For your day has come, The time that I visit you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>50:32</a></td><td class=td>狂傲的必絆跌仆倒，無人扶起。我也必使火在他的城邑中著起，將他四圍所有的盡行燒滅。<br>And Pride will stumble and fall, And there will be no one to raise him up. And I will kindle a fire in his cities, And it will devour all that is around him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>50:33</a></td><td class=td>萬軍之耶和華如此說，以色列人和猶大人一同受欺壓；凡擄掠他們的，都緊緊抓住他們，不肯釋放。<br>Thus says Jehovah of hosts, The children of Israel And the children of Judah are oppressed together; And all who took them captive held them fast; They refused to let them go.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=42>50:42</a></td><td class=td>他們拿弓和槍，性情殘忍，毫無憐憫。他們的聲音，像海浪匉訇；巴比倫的女子阿，他們都騎馬擺隊，如上戰場的人來攻擊你。<br>They grasp bow and spear; They are cruel and have no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, And they ride upon horses, Set in array as a man for battle Against you, O daughter of Babylon.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=43>50:43</a></td><td class=td>巴比倫王聽見他們的風聲，手就發軟；痛苦將他抓住，疼痛仿佛正在生產的婦人。<br>The king of Babylon has heard the report about them, And his hands are feeble; Distress has seized him, Pain like a woman in childbirth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=44>50:44</a></td><td class=td>必有一人像獅子從約但河邊的叢林上來，攻擊堅固的居所；轉眼之間，我要使他們逃跑離開她；誰蒙揀選，我就派誰治理她。誰能像我呢？誰能給我定規日期呢？誰是那能在我麵前站立的牧人呢？<br>Indeed, one will come up like a lion From the majesty of the Jordan against a secure habitation; For I will suddenly make them run away from her; And whoever is chosen I will appoint over her. For who is like Me? And who can appoint Me a time? And who is that shepherd who can stand before Me?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=45>50:45</a></td><td class=td>所以你們要聽耶和華攻擊巴比倫所設的謀略，和祂攻擊迦勒底人之地所定的意念：仇敵定要將他們羊群中微小的拉去；祂定要使他們的居所荒涼。<br>Therefore hear the counsel of Jehovah, Which He purposed against Babylon, And His thoughts, which He has thought Against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they will drag them off, the little ones of the flock; Surely He will make their  habitation a desolation because of them.</td></tr>
