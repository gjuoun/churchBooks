<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>12:5</a></td><td class=td>那時，猶大的首領因為示撒就聚集在耶路撒冷；有申言者示瑪雅去見羅波安和眾首領，對他們說，耶和華如此說，你們離棄了我，所以我也離棄你們，把你們交在示撒手裏。<br>And Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who were gathered in Jerusalem because of Shishak; and he said to them, Thus says Jehovah, You have forsaken Me, so I also have forsaken you, delivering you into the hand of Shishak.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>12:12</a></td><td class=td>王自卑的時候，耶和華的怒氣就從他轉消，不將他們滅盡，並且在猶大中間也有善益的事。<br>And when he humbled himself, the anger of Jehovah turned away from him, and He did not destroy them completely; and also things in Judah were good.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>12:13</a></td><td class=td>羅波安王自強，在耶路撒冷作王。他登基的時候年四十一歲，在耶路撒冷，就是耶和華從以色列眾支派中所選擇立祂名的城，作王十七年。羅波安的母親名叫拿瑪，是亞捫人。<br>So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city where Jehovah had chosen, out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name.
