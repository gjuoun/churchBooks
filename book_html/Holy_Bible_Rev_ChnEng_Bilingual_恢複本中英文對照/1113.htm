<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>弟兄們，你們自己原曉得，我們進到你們那裏，並不是徒然的。<br>For you yourselves know, brothers, our entrance toward you, that it has not been in vain. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>我們從前在腓立比受苦害，又被淩辱，就如你們所知道的，然而還是在我們的神裏麵放膽，在極大的爭戰中，對你們講說了神的福音。<br>But having suffered previously and having been outrageously treated, even as you know, in Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much struggle. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>我們的勸勉不是出於錯謬，不是出於汙穢，也不是用詭詐；<br>For our exhortation is not out of deception nor out of uncleanness nor in guile; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>但神怎樣驗中了我們，把福音托付我們，我們就照樣講，不是要討人喜歡，乃是要討那察驗我們心的神喜歡。<br>But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men but God, who proves our hearts. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>因為我們從來沒有用過諂媚的話，就如你們所知道的；也沒有藉掩飾而貪婪，這是神可以作見證的。<br>For neither were we found at any time with flattering speech, even as you know, nor with a pretext for covetousness; God is witness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>我們作基督的使徒，雖然有權利叫人尊重，卻沒有向你們，或向別人，尋求從人來的榮耀；<br>Nor did we seek glory from men, neither from you nor from others, though we could have stood on our authority as apostles of Christ. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>隻在你們中間為人溫和，如同乳母顧惜自己的孩子。<br>But we were gentle in your midst, as a nursing mother would cherish her own children. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>我們這樣切慕你們，不但樂意將神的福音分給你們，連自己的性命也願意分給你們，因你們是我們所愛的。<br>Yearning in this way over you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls, because you became beloved to us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>弟兄們，你們原記得我們的勞碌辛苦；我們是晝夜作工，把神的福音傳揚給你們，免得叫你們任何人受累。<br>For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: While working night and day so as not to be burdensome to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>你們和神可以作見證，我們向你們信的人，是何等聖、義、無可指摘，<br>You are witnesses, as well as God, how in a holy and righteous and blameless manner we conducted ourselves toward you who believe, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>正如你們所知道的，我們怎樣勸勉你們，撫慰你們，向你們作見證，待你們每一個人，好像父親待自己的孩子一樣；<br>Just as you know how we were to each one of you, as a father to his own children, exhorting you and consoling you and testifying, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>要叫你們行事為人，配得過那召你們進入祂自己的國和榮耀的神。<br>So that you might walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into His own kingdom and glory. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>所以，我們也不住的感謝神，因為你們既接受了從我們所聽見神的話，就不以為是人的話，乃以為是神的話而領受了；這話確是神的，也運行在你們信的人裏麵。<br>And because of this we also thank God unceasingly that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but even as it truly is, the word of God, which also operates in you who believe. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>弟兄們，你們曾效法猶太地在基督耶穌裏神的眾召會；因為你們也受了自己同族人同樣的苦害，正如他們從猶太人所受的一樣。<br>For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus, for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they also from the Jews, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>這些猶太人殺了主耶穌和申言者，又驅逐了我們；他們不得神的喜悅，且與眾人敵對；<br>Who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and drove us out; and they are not pleasing to God and are contrary to all men, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>攔阻我們向外邦人講道，使他們得救，以致常常充滿自己的罪。忿怒臨到他們身上，已經到了極處。<br>In that they forbid us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, so that they fill up their sins always. But wrath has come upon them to the uttermost. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>弟兄們，我們如同喪失親人一般，暫時與你們分離，是麵目的，不是心裏的，我們越發急切，極其巴望要見你們的麵。<br>But we, brothers, having been bereaved of you for a little while, in presence, not in heart, were more abundantly eager with great desire to see your face. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>所以我們有意到你們那裏，我保羅確曾一次兩次要去，隻是撒但攔阻了我們。<br>Therefore we wanted to come to you, indeed I Paul, both once and again, yet Satan hindered us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>我們主耶穌來臨的時候，我們在祂麵前的盼望、喜樂、或所誇的冠冕是什麼？不就是你們麼？<br>For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at His coming? Are not even you? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>2:20</a></td><td class=td>因為你們就是我們的榮耀、我們的喜樂。<br>For you are our glory and joy. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
