<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>1:1</a></td><td class=td>當士師秉政的時候，以色列地遭遇饑荒。有一個人帶著妻子和兩個兒子，從猶大的伯利恒往摩押鄉間去寄居。<br>Now in the days when the judges  ruled, there was a famine in the land. And a man from Bethlehem in Judah went down to dwell as a sojourner in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>1:2</a></td><td class=td>這人名叫以利米勒，他妻子名叫拿俄米；他兩個兒子，一個名叫瑪倫，一個名叫基連，都是猶大伯利恒的以法他人。他們到了摩押鄉間，就住在那裏。<br>And the man's name was Elimelech, and his wife's name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah. And they went to the country of Moab and remained there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>1:3</a></td><td class=td>後來拿俄米的丈夫以利米勒死了，剩下婦人和她兩個兒子。<br>And Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left with her two sons.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>1:4</a></td><td class=td>這兩個兒子娶了摩押女子為妻，一個名叫俄珥巴，一個名叫路得，在那裏住了約有十年。<br>And they took wives for themselves from among the Moabite women. One's name was Orpah, and the second's name was Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>1:5</a></td><td class=td>瑪倫和基連二人也死了，剩下婦人拿俄米，兩個孩子沒有了，丈夫也沒有了。<br>And both Mahlon and Chilion died, and the woman was left without her two children and her husband.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>1:6</a></td><td class=td>她就與兩個兒媳起身，要從摩押鄉間歸回；因為她在摩押鄉間聽見耶和華眷顧祂的百姓，賜糧食與他們。<br>Then she rose up with her daughters-in-law in order to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that Jehovah had visited His people by giving them food.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>1:7</a></td><td class=td>於是她帶同兩個兒媳，起行離開所在的地方，上路回猶大地去。<br>So she went forth from the place where she had been, along with her two daughters-in-law; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>1:8</a></td><td class=td>拿俄米對兩個兒媳說，你們各人回娘家去罷。願耶和華以恩慈待你們，像你們以恩慈待已死的人與我一樣。<br>And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go and return, each of you, to your mother's house. May Jehovah deal kindly with you, just as you have dealt with the dead and with me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>1:9</a></td><td class=td>願耶和華使你們各在新夫家中尋得安息。於是拿俄米與她們親嘴，她們就放聲而哭，<br>May Jehovah grant you to find rest, each of you in the house of your husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice and wept.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>1:10</a></td><td class=td>說，不然，我們必與你一同回你本民那裏去。<br>And they said to her, No, we will return with you to your people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>1:11</a></td><td class=td>拿俄米說，我女兒們哪，回去罷。為何要跟我去呢？我腹中還有兒子可以作你們的丈夫麼？<br>And Naomi said, Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>1:12</a></td><td class=td>我女兒們哪，回去罷；我年紀老邁，不能再有丈夫。即或我說，我還有指望，今夜有丈夫可以生子，<br>Return, my daughters, go; for I am too old to have a husband. If I said, I have hope; even if I had a husband tonight and even bore sons;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>1:13</a></td><td class=td>你們豈能等著他們長大呢？你們豈能為他們守身不嫁人呢？我女兒們哪，不要這樣。我比你們更是愁苦，因為耶和華伸手攻擊我。<br>Would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from having a husband? No, my daughters; it has been far more bitter for me than it should be for you, for the hand of Jehovah has gone forth against me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>1:14</a></td><td class=td>兩個兒媳又放聲而哭；俄珥巴與婆婆親嘴而別，隻是路得緊緊隨著婆婆。<br>And they lifted up their voice and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother- in-law, but Ruth clung to her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>1:15</a></td><td class=td>拿俄米說，看哪，你嫂子已經回她本民和她的神那裏去了，你也跟著你嫂子回去罷。<br>And she said, Your sister-in-law has now returned to her people and to her gods; return with your sister-in-law.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>1:16</a></td><td class=td>路得說，不要催我離開你回去不跟隨你。你往那裏去，我也往那裏去；你在那裏住宿，我也在那裏住宿；你的民就是我的民，你的神就是我的神。<br>But Ruth said, Do not entreat me to leave you and turn away from following after you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you dwell, I will dwell; and your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>1:17</a></td><td class=td>你在那裏死，我也在那裏死，也葬在那裏。除非死能使你我相離，不然，願耶和華重重的降罰與我。<br>Where you die, I will die; and there will I be buried. Jehovah do so to me, and more as well, if anything but death parts me from you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>1:18</a></td><td class=td>拿俄米見路得定意要跟隨自己去，就不再對她說什麼了。<br>And when  Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she ceased speaking to her about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>1:19</a></td><td class=td>於是二人同行，來到伯利恒。她們到了伯利恒，合城的人就都因她們驚動；婦女們說，這不是拿俄米麼？<br>So the two of them traveled until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came to Bethlehem, all the city was stirred because of them; and the women said, Is this Naomi?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>1:20</a></td><td class=td>拿俄米對她們說，不要叫我拿俄米，要叫我瑪拉，因為全足者使我受了大苦。<br>And she said to them, Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara; for the All-sufficient One has dealt very bitterly with me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>1:21</a></td><td class=td>我滿滿的出去，耶和華使我空空的回來。耶和華使我受苦，全足者以禍患待我。既是這樣，你們為何還叫我拿俄米呢？<br>I went out full, but Jehovah has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, when Jehovah has  afflicted me and the All-sufficient One has dealt harshly with me?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>1:22</a></td><td class=td>拿俄米和她兒媳摩押女子路得，從摩押鄉間回來；她們到了伯利恒，正是動手割大麥的時候。<br>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned from the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
