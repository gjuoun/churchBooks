<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>5:10</a></td><td class=td>信入神兒子的，就有這見證在他裏麵。不信神的，就是將神當作說謊的，因他不信入神為祂兒子所作的見證。<br>He who believes into the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son. </td></tr>
