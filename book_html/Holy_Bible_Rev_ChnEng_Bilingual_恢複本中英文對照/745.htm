<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>66:1</a></td><td class=td>耶和華如此說，天是我的座位，地是我的腳凳；你們要在那裏為我建造殿宇？那裏是我安息的地方？<br>Thus says Jehovah, Heaven is my throne, And the earth the footstool for My feet. Where then is the house that you will build for Me,  And where is the place of My rest?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>66:2</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，這一切都是我手所造的，所以就都有了；但我所看顧的，就是靈裏貧窮痛悔、因我話戰兢的人。<br>For all these things My hand has made, And so all these things have come into being, declares Jehovah. But to this kind of man will I look, to him who is poor And of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>66:3</a></td><td class=td>宰牛的好像殺人的；獻羊羔的好像打折狗頸的；獻素祭的好像獻豬血的；燒乳香的好像頌讚偶像的。這等人揀選自己的道路，魂裏喜悅他們那些可憎惡的事；<br>He who kills an ox is like him who slays a man; He who sacrifices a lamb, like him who breaks a dog's neck; He who offers a meal offering is like him who offers the blood of swine; He who burns incense is like him who blesses an idol. As surely as they have chosen their own ways, And their soul delights in their abominations;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>66:4</a></td><td class=td>我也必揀選那愚弄他們的事，使他們所懼怕的臨到他們；因為我呼喚，無人答應；我說話，他們不聽從；反倒行我眼中看為惡的，揀選我所不喜悅的。<br>Just as surely I will choose what will treat them ill, And I will bring upon them what they dread; Because I called, but no one  answered; I spoke, but they did not listen; But they did evil in My sight, And chose that in which I did not delight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>66:5</a></td><td class=td>你們因耶和華言語戰兢的人，當聽祂的話：你們的弟兄，就是恨惡你們，因我名趕出你們的，曾說，願耶和華得榮耀，使我們得見你們的喜樂；但蒙羞的乃是他們。<br>Hear the word of Jehovah, You who tremble at His word: Your brothers who hate you, Who cast you out because of My name, said, Let Jehovah be glorified So that we may see your joy. But they will be put to shame.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>66:6</a></td><td class=td>有喧嘩的聲音出自城中！有聲音出於殿中！是耶和華向祂仇敵施行報應的聲音。<br>A voice of tumult from the city! A voice from the temple! The voice of Jehovah giving full Recompense to His enemies.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>66:7</a></td><td class=td>她未曾劬勞，就生產；未覺疼痛，就生出男孩。<br>Before she travailed, She brought forth; Before her pain came, She gave birth to a man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>66:8</a></td><td class=td>一地的民豈能一日而生？一國的人豈能一時而產？因為錫安一劬勞，便生下兒女；這樣的事，誰曾聽見？誰曾看見？<br>Who has heard of such a thing? Who has seen such things? Can a land be born in one day? Or can a nation be brought forth all at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, She brought forth her children.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>66:9</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，我既使她臨產，豈不使她生產呢？你的神說，我既是使她生產的，豈能使她閉胎不生呢？<br>Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth? Says Jehovah. Or shall I who cause to bring forth shut the womb? Says your God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>66:10</a></td><td class=td>你們愛耶路撒冷的，都要與她一同喜樂，且要因她歡騰；你們為她悲哀的，都要與她一同樂上加樂；<br>Be joyful with Jerusalem and exult for her, All you who love her; Rejoice with her in joy, All you who mourn over her,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>66:11</a></td><td class=td>使你們在她安慰的懷中吃奶得飽，使你們得她豐盛的榮耀，猶如擠奶，滿心喜樂。<br>So that you may nurse and be  satisfied With her breasts of consolations, So that you may draw out from her and take excellent delight In the abundance of her glory.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>66:12</a></td><td class=td>耶和華如此說，我要使平安延及她，好像江河；使列國的榮耀延及她，如同漲溢的河；你們要從中咂奶；你們必蒙抱在肋旁，搖弄在膝上。<br>For thus says Jehovah, I now am extending to her Peace like a river, And the glory of the nations Like an overflowing stream; And you will nurse, you will be carried on the hip, And you will be bounced on the knees.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>66:13</a></td><td class=td>人怎樣受母親安慰，我就照樣安慰你們；你們也必在耶路撒冷得安慰。<br>As one whom his mother comforts, So will I comfort you; And you will be comforted in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>66:14</a></td><td class=td>你們看見，心就快樂，你們的骨頭必得滋潤，像嫩草一樣；而且耶和華的仆人必得知祂手所行的，祂也要向仇敵發惱恨。<br>And you will see this, and your heart will rejoice, And your bones will flourish like new grass; And the hand of Jehovah will be made known to His servants, And He will be indignant toward His enemies.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>66:15</a></td><td class=td>看哪，耶和華必在火中來臨；祂的車輦像旋風，以烈怒施行報應，以火焰施行斥責；<br>For behold, Jehovah will come with fire, And His chariots will be like a whirlwind, To render His anger with fury And His rebuke with flames of  fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>66:16</a></td><td class=td>因為耶和華在一切有血肉的人身上，必以火與刀施行審判；被耶和華所殺的必甚多。<br>For with fire Jehovah will execute judgment, And with His sword, upon all flesh; And those slain by Jehovah will be many.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>66:17</a></td><td class=td>那些分別為聖，潔淨自己的，進入園內跟在其中一個人的後頭，吃豬肉和可憎之物並老鼠，他們必一同滅絕，這是耶和華說的。<br>Those who sanctify and purify themselves for the gardens, Following after one in the midst, Eating swine's flesh And what is abominable and even mice, Will come to an end together, declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>66:18</a></td><td class=td>至於我，我必對他們的行為和他們的意念施行報應；時候將到，我必將各邦國各方言的人聚來；他們必來看我的榮耀。<br>But I-their works and their thoughts I will repay; the time is coming to gather all the nations and tongues; and they will come and see My glory.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>66:19</a></td><td class=td>我要在他們中間顯神跡，又從他們中間把逃脫的人差到列國去，就是到他施、弗和路德那些拉弓的人那裏，到土巴和雅完，到素來沒有聽見我名聲，沒有看見我榮耀的遼遠海島；他們必將我的榮耀傳揚在列國中。<br>And I will set a sign among them and will send those who have escaped from them unto the nations: to Tarshish, Put, and Lud, to those who draw the bow; to Tubal and Javan, to the distant coastlands that have not heard My fame nor seen My glory; and they will declare My glory among the nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>66:20</a></td><td class=td>他們必用馬、用車、用轎、用騾子、用獨峰駝，將你們所有的弟兄，從列國送到我的聖山耶路撒冷，作為素祭獻給耶和華，好像以色列人用潔淨的器皿把素祭奉到耶和華的殿中；這是耶和華說的。<br>And they will bring all your brothers from all the nations as a meal offering to Jehovah, on horses and in chariots and in wagons and on mules and on camels, to My holy mountain, Jerusalem, says Jehovah, just as the children of Israel bring their meal offering in a clean vessel to the house of Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>66:21</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，我也必從他們中間取人為祭司，為利未人。<br>And I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites, says Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>66:22</a></td><td class=td>耶和華說，我所造的新天新地怎樣在我麵前常存，你們的後裔和你們的名字，也必照樣常存。<br>For as the new heavens And new earth, which I make, Remain before Me, declares Jehovah, So will your seed and your name remain.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>66:23</a></td><td class=td>每逢月朔、安息日，凡有血肉的必來在我麵前下拜；這是耶和華說的。<br>And from new moon to new moon And from Sabbath to Sabbath All flesh will come To bow down before Me, says Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>66:24</a></td><td class=td>他們必出去觀看那些違背我之人的屍首；因為他們的蟲是不死的，他們的火是不滅的；凡有血肉的，都必憎惡他們。<br>Then they will go forth and look On the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me; For their worm will not die, Nor will their fire be quenched; And they will be an abhorrence to all flesh.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
