<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>44:2</a></td><td class=td>造作你，又從母腹裏就塑造你，並要幫助你的耶和華如此說，我的仆人雅各，我所揀選的耶書侖哪，不要害怕；<br>Thus says Jehovah your Maker And the One who formed you from the womb, who will help you, Do not fear, O Jacob, My servant, And Jeshurun whom I have chosen,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>44:3</a></td><td class=td>因為我要將水澆灌幹渴之處，將河澆灌幹旱之地；我要將我的靈澆灌你的後裔，將我的福澆灌你的子孫。<br>For I will pour water upon the thirsty land, And streams upon the dry ground; I will pour out My Spirit upon your seed, And My blessing upon your offspring.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>44:4</a></td><td class=td>他們要在草中長起，像溪水旁的柳樹。<br>They will spring up among the grass, Like poplars beside the flowing streams of water.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>44:5</a></td><td class=td>這個要說，我是屬耶和華的；那個要以雅各的名自稱；又一個要親手寫，我是屬耶和華的，並要以以色列這名自稱。<br>One will say, I am Jehovah's; Another will call himself by the name of Jacob; Another will write  with his hand,  I am Jehovah's; He will name himself with the name Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>44:6</a></td><td class=td>耶和華以色列的王，以色列的救贖主萬軍之耶和華如此說，我是首先的，我是末後的，除我以外再沒有神。<br>Thus says Jehovah the King of Israel, And his Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts, I am the First and I am the Last, And apart from Me there is no God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>44:7</a></td><td class=td>自從我設立古時的民，誰能像我這樣宣告？讓他表明，並依次向我陳說。讓他們將要來的事和必成的事說明。<br>And who can proclaim as I can? Then let him declare it and recount it in order for Me, Since I set forth the people of ancient times. Let them declare to them both the coming things And the things which will take place.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>44:8</a></td><td class=td>你們不要恐懼，也不要害怕。我豈不是從上古就說給你們聽，指示了你們麼？並且你們是我的見證人。除我以外，豈有神麼？豈有別的磐石麼？我不知道有那一個。<br>Do not tremble and do not be afraid. Have I not related to you from that time and declared it? And you are My witnesses. Is there a God besides Me? Or is there any other Rock? I do not know of any.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>44:11</a></td><td class=td>看哪，偶像的同夥都必羞愧，因為工匠不過是人。任他們眾人聚會，任他們站立，任他們懼怕，一同羞愧。<br>Indeed, all those joined to him will be put to shame, For the craftsmen are only men. Let all of them be gathered together, let them stand up; Let them be afraid and be put to shame together.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>44:12</a></td><td class=td>鐵匠磨利切割的工具，在火炭中操作，用錘打造偶像，用他有力的膀臂製作；但他也會饑餓無力，不喝水就發倦。<br>The ironsmith sharpens a cutting tool,  And works over the coals, And forms the idol with hammers, And he works it with the strength of his arm. Yet he becomes hungry and has no strength; If he does not drink water, he faints.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>44:13</a></td><td class=td>木匠拉線，用筆畫出樣子；用刨子刨成形狀，用圓尺畫了模樣；他仿照人的樣式、人的俊美，將偶像造作而成，好住在房屋中。<br>The carpenter stretches out a line; He marks it out with a marking tool; He works it with planes, And marks it with a compass. He makes it according to the likeness of a man, Like the beautiful appearance of man, to dwell in a house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>44:14</a></td><td class=td>有人豫備為自己砍伐香柏樹，或取柏樹和橡樹；他讓樹在樹林中長得茁壯；他栽種白楊樹，得雨水滋養。<br>Someone prepares to cut down cedars for himself, Or he takes a cypress or an oak; He lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest; He plants an ash, and the rain nourishes it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>44:15</a></td><td class=td>這樹，人可用以燒火；他自己取些烤火，又燒著烤餅；而且作神像跪拜，作雕製的偶像向它叩拜。<br>It is also something for a man to burn; He takes one of them and warms himself; He even kindles a fire and bakes bread. With the same he also makes a god and worships it; He makes it into a graven image and bows down before it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>44:16</a></td><td class=td>他把一半燒在火中，用這一半烤肉吃，烤了肉，也吃飽了；又自己烤火，說，阿哈，我暖和了，我見火了。<br>Half of it he burns in a fire; Over this half he eats flesh, And he roasts a roast and is satisfied. He also warms himself and says, Ha! I am warm, I have seen fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>44:17</a></td><td class=td>他用剩下的作了一個神像，就是雕製的偶像；他向這偶像俯伏叩拜，禱告它說，求你拯救我，因你是我的神。<br>The rest of it he makes into a god, into his idol; He bows down to it and worships  it And prays to it and says, Deliver me, for you are my god.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>44:18</a></td><td class=td>他們不知道，也不明白，因為耶和華遮住他們的眼，叫他們不能看見，塞住他們的心，叫他們不能明白。<br>They do not know, and they do not understand, For He has covered their eyes  so that they cannot see, And their minds so that they cannot understand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>44:19</a></td><td class=td>沒有人心裏醒悟，也沒有人有知識或聰明，說，我曾把一半在火中燒了，在炭火上烤過餅；我也烤過肉吃。這剩下的，我豈要作成可憎的物麼？我豈可向木塊叩拜呢？<br>And no one considers in his heart, And there is no knowledge or understanding to say, I have burned half of it in the fire, And I have even baked bread over its coals; I have roasted flesh and eaten it. Then shall I make the rest of it into an abomination? Shall I fall down before a block of wood?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>44:20</a></td><td class=td>他以灰為食；他的心被迷惑，使他偏離正路；他不能救自己的魂；也不能說，我右手中豈不是有虛謊麼？<br>He feeds on ashes; A deceived heart has led him  astray; And he cannot deliver his soul; Nor does he say, Is this not a lie in my right hand?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>44:21</a></td><td class=td>雅各、以色列阿，要記念這些事，因你是我的仆人。我塑造了你，你是我的仆人；以色列阿，你必不會被我忘記。<br>Remember these things, O Jacob,  And Israel, for you are My servant. I have formed you; you are My servant; O Israel, you will not be forgotten by Me.</td></tr>

Shout, O lower parts of the earth; Break forth with singing,   O mountains, The forest and every tree in it; For Jehovah has redeemed Jacob And is glorified in Israel.</td></tr>
