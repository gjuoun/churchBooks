<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=28>7:28</a></td><td class=td>那時耶穌在殿裏施教，大聲說，你們認識我，也曉得我是那裏的；我並不是從自己來的，但那差我來的是真的，你們不認識祂；<br>Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, You both know Me and know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>7:32</a></td><td class=td>法利賽人聽見群眾唧咕議論這些關於耶穌的事，祭司長和法利賽人就打發差役去捉拿祂。<br>The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent attendants to arrest Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>7:33</a></td><td class=td>於是耶穌說，我還有不多的時候和你們同在，以後就回到差我來的那裏去。<br>Jesus therefore said, I am still with you a little while, and then I am going to Him who sent Me. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>7:35</a></td><td class=td>猶太人就彼此說，這人要往那裏去，叫我們找不著？難道祂要往散居在希利尼人中的猶太人那裏，去教訓希利尼人麼？<br>The Jews then said to one another, Where is this man about to go that we will not find Him? Is He about to go to the Jews in dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>7:36</a></td><td class=td>祂說，你們要找我，卻找不著，我所在的地方，你們不能到。這話是什麼意思？<br>What is the word which He said, You will seek Me and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=37>7:37</a></td><td class=td>節期的末日，就是最大之日，耶穌站著高聲說，人若渴了，可以到我這裏來喝。<br>Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=38>7:38</a></td><td class=td>信入我的人，就如經上所說，從他腹中要流出活水的江河來。<br>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=39>7:39</a></td><td class=td>耶穌這話是指著信入祂的人將要受的那靈說的；那時還沒有那靈，因為耶穌尚未得著榮耀。<br>But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=40>7:40</a></td><td class=td>群眾聽見這話，有的說，這真是那申言者。<br>Some of the crowd therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is truly the Prophet. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=41>7:41</a></td><td class=td>另有的說，這是基督。但也有的說，基督豈是從加利利出來的麼？<br>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Does then the Christ come out of Galilee? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=42>7:42</a></td><td class=td>經上豈不是說，基督是出於大衛的後裔，是從大衛的本鄉伯利恒出來的麼？<br>Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes out of the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=43>7:43</a></td><td class=td>於是群眾因著耶穌起了分裂。<br>So there arose a division among the crowd because of Him. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=45>7:45</a></td><td class=td>差役回到祭司長和法利賽人那裏，他們對差役說，你們為什麼沒有帶祂來？<br>The attendants therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and these said to them, Why did you not bring Him? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=46>7:46</a></td><td class=td>差役回答說，從來沒有像祂這樣說話的。<br>The attendants answered, Never has a man spoken as this man has. </td></tr>
