<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>30:2</a></td><td class=td>因為王和眾首領，並耶路撒冷全會眾已經商議，要在二月守逾越節；<br>For the king and his officers and all the congregation in Jerusalem had taken counsel to hold the Passover in the second month,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>30:3</a></td><td class=td>正月間他們不能守，因為使自己分別為聖的祭司尚不敷用，百姓也沒有聚集在耶路撒冷。<br>Because they could not hold it at that time, for the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number nor had the people gathered to Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>30:4</a></td><td class=td>王與全會眾都以這事為美。<br>And the matter seemed right in the sight of the king and in the sight of all the congregation.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>30:6</a></td><td class=td>跑信的就帶著王和眾首領手中所發的信，遵著王命走遍全以色列和猶大；信內說，以色列人哪，你們當轉向耶和華亞伯拉罕、以撒、以色列的神，好叫祂轉向你們這脫離亞述諸王之手的餘民。<br>And as the king had commanded, the runners went with the letters from the hand of the king and his officers throughout all Israel and Judah, saying, You children of Israel, return to Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and He will return to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>30:7</a></td><td class=td>你們不要像你們的列祖和你們的弟兄一樣；他們幹犯耶和華他們列祖的神，以致耶和華使他們荒涼，正如你們所見的。<br>And do not be like your fathers and like your brothers, who trespassed against Jehovah, the God of their fathers, so that He made them a desolation, as you now see.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>30:9</a></td><td class=td>你們若轉向耶和華，你們的弟兄和兒女必在擄掠他們的人麵前蒙憐恤，得以歸回這地，因為耶和華你們的神有恩典、有憐恤；你們若轉向祂，祂必不轉臉不顧你們。<br>For when you turn to Jehovah, your brothers and your children will find compassion before those who led them captive and will return to this land, for Jehovah your God is gracious and compassionate, and will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=10>30:10</a></td><td class=td>跑信的就由這城到那城，走遍以法蓮和瑪拿西地，直到西布倫；那裏的人卻戲笑他們，譏誚他們。<br>So the runners passed from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh and as far as Zebulun, but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>30:11</a></td><td class=td>然而亞設、瑪拿西、西布倫中也有人自卑，來到耶路撒冷。<br>Nevertheless some men from Asher and Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>30:16</a></td><td class=td>他們遵著神人摩西的律法，照例站在自己的地方；祭司從利未人手裏接過血來，灑在壇上。<br>And they stood at their station after their custom, according to the law of Moses, the man of God: The priests sprinkled the blood that they received from the hand of the Levites.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>30:17</a></td><td class=td>會中有許多人尚未使自己分別為聖，所以利未人為一切不潔之人宰逾越節的羊羔，使他們聖別歸耶和華。<br>For there were many in the congregation who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites were charged with slaughtering the passover sacrifices for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to Jehovah.</td></tr>
