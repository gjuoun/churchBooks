<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=1>9:1</a></td><td class=td>但那受過困苦之處，必不再見幽暗：從前神使西布倫地和拿弗他利地被藐視，末後卻使這沿海的路，約但河外，外邦人的加利利，得著榮耀。<br>But gloom does not remain in the place where there was anguish: formerly He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali contemptibly, but afterward He treats the way of the sea, across the Jordan, with glory, Galilee of the nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=2>9:2</a></td><td class=td>那行走在黑暗中的百姓，看見了大光；那些住在死蔭之地的人，有光照耀他們。<br>The people who walked in the darkness Have seen a great light; Upon those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death Light has shined.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>9:3</a></td><td class=td>你使這國民繁多，加增他們的喜樂；他們在你麵前歡喜，好像收割時的歡喜，像人分擄物那樣的快樂。<br>You have multiplied the nation; You have increased their gladness; They are glad before You as with the gladness of harvest, As men rejoice when they divide the spoil.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>9:4</a></td><td class=td>因為他們所負的重軛和肩頭上的杖，就是欺壓他們之人的棍，你已經折斷，好像在米甸的日子一樣。<br>For You break the yoke of their burden And the staff on their shoulder, The rod of their oppressor, As in the day of Midian.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>9:5</a></td><td class=td>戰士在鏖戰震地之中所穿的戰靴，並那輥在血中的衣服，都必作為可燒的，當作燃料。<br>For all the boots Of those who in boots trample in the battle quake And the garments Rolled in blood Are for burning; They are fuel for fire.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=11>9:11</a></td><td class=td>因此，耶和華要高舉利汛的敵人，來攻擊以色列，並要激動以色列的仇敵。<br>Then Jehovah exalts the adversaries of Rezin against them And goads their enemies on.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=12>9:12</a></td><td class=td>東有亞蘭人，西有非利士人：他們張口吞吃以色列。雖然如此，耶和華的怒氣還未轉消，祂的手仍然伸出。<br>Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west: They devour Israel with an open mouth. By all this His anger is not turned; His hand is still outstretched.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=13>9:13</a></td><td class=td>這百姓還沒有歸向擊打他們的主，也沒有尋求萬軍之耶和華。<br>Yet the people do not turn to Him who strikes them, Nor do they seek Jehovah of  hosts.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>9:17</a></td><td class=td>所以主必不喜悅他們的少年人，也不憐恤他們的孤兒寡婦；因為他們都是不虔敬的，是行惡的，並且各人的口都說愚妄的話。雖然如此，耶和華的怒氣還未轉消，祂的手仍然伸出。<br>Because of this the Lord will not rejoice in their young men, And He will not have compassion on their orphans and widows; For all of them are profane and evildoers, And every mouth speaks foolishness. By all this His anger is not turned; His hand is still outstretched.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>9:18</a></td><td class=td>邪惡像火焚燒，燒滅荊棘和蒺藜；在叢林中著起來，就旋轉上騰，成為煙柱。<br>For wickedness burns like a fire; It devours thorn and thistle, And burns in the forest thickets; And it rolls up into a column of smoke.</td></tr>
