<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=3>23:3</a></td><td class=td>她們在埃及行邪淫，在幼年時行邪淫；她們在那裏作處女的時候，有人撫摸她們的胸，撫弄她們的乳。<br>And they committed fornication in Egypt; in their youth they committed fornication; there their breasts were pressed, and there their virgin bosoms were handled.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=4>23:4</a></td><td class=td>她們的名字：姐姐是阿荷拉，妹妹是阿荷利巴；她們都歸於我，生了兒女。論到她們的名字，阿荷拉就是撒瑪利亞，阿荷利巴就是耶路撒冷。<br>And their names were Oholah, the older one, and Oholibah, her sister; and they became Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem is Oholibah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=5>23:5</a></td><td class=td>阿荷拉離開我行邪淫，貪戀所愛的人，就是鄰近的亞述人；<br>And Oholah committed fornication instead of remaining with Me, and she lusted after her lovers, after the Assyrians, who were close to her,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=6>23:6</a></td><td class=td>這些人都穿紫衣，作省長和官長，都是可愛的少年人，是騎著馬的騎士。<br>Who were clothed in purple, governors and officials, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding horses.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=7>23:7</a></td><td class=td>阿荷拉就與他們放縱淫行，他們都是亞述人中最美的男子；她因一切所貪戀之人，因他們的一切偶像，玷汙了自己。<br>And she bestowed her fornication upon them, all of them the choice men of Assyria; and with all whom she lusted after, with all their idols, she defiled herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=8>23:8</a></td><td class=td>她沒有離開從她在埃及的時候就犯的淫亂；因為她年幼作處女的時候，埃及人就與她同寢，撫摸她的乳，縱欲與她行淫。<br>And she did not abandon her fornication from her time in Egypt; for in her youth they had lain with her, and they had handled her virgin bosom, and they had poured out their fornication upon her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=9>23:9</a></td><td class=td>因此，我將她交在她所愛的人手中，就是她所貪戀的亞述人手中。<br>Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians whom she lusted after.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=14>23:14</a></td><td class=td>阿荷利巴又加增淫行：她看見人像畫在牆上，就是用丹色所畫迦勒底人的像，<br>And she increased her fornication: When she saw men portrayed upon the wall, images of Chaldeans portrayed in vermillion,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=15>23:15</a></td><td class=td>腰間係著帶子，頭上有下垂的裹頭巾，都是軍長的形狀，仿照巴比倫人的形像，他們的出生地就是迦勒底；<br>Girded with belts upon their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, like the  Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their birth;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=16>23:16</a></td><td class=td>阿荷利巴一看見就貪戀他們，打發使者往迦勒底去見他們。<br>She lusted after them, her eyes seeing them; and she sent messengers to them in Chaldea.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=17>23:17</a></td><td class=td>巴比倫人就來，上了她愛情的床，與她行淫玷汙她。她被玷汙，隨後心裏與他們生疏。<br>And the Babylonians came to her at the bed of love and defiled her with their fornication. And when she had been defiled by them, her  desire for them departed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=18>23:18</a></td><td class=td>這樣，她顯露淫行，又顯露下體；我心就與她生疏，像先前與她姐姐生疏一樣。<br>Thus she uncovered her fornication and she uncovered her nakedness, and My desire for her departed, as My desire for her sister had departed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=19>23:19</a></td><td class=td>她還加增她的淫行，追念她幼年在埃及地行邪淫的日子。<br>Yet she multiplied her fornication by recalling the days of her youth, when she committed fornication in the land of Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=20>23:20</a></td><td class=td>她貪戀那些身壯如驢，精足如馬的情人。<br>And she lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=21>23:21</a></td><td class=td>這樣，你就渴想你幼年的淫行；那時，埃及人撫摸你幼年的胸，撫弄你的乳。<br>Thus you sought after the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom because of the breasts of your youth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=22>23:22</a></td><td class=td>因此，阿荷利巴阿，主耶和華如此說，我必激動你所愛，而後心裏生疏的人來攻擊你，我必領他們從四圍來攻擊你。<br>Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord Jehovah, I am now rousing your lovers against you, from whom your desire departed, and am bringing them against you from all around:</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=23>23:23</a></td><td class=td>所來的就是巴比倫人、迦勒底的眾人、比割人、書亞人、哥亞人，同著他們的還有亞述眾人，是可愛的少年人，都是作省長和官長、作軍長有名聲的，都騎著馬。<br>The Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and officials all of them, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=24>23:24</a></td><td class=td>他們必帶兵器、戰車、輜重車，率領聚集的眾民來攻擊你；他們要拿大小盾牌，頂盔擺陣，在你四圍攻擊你。我要將審判的事交給他們，他們必按著自己的條例審判你。<br>And they will come against you with weapons, chariots and wheels, and with a company of peoples; they will set shield and buckler and helmet against you all around. And I will set judgment before them, and they will judge according to their judgments.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=25>23:25</a></td><td class=td>我必以妒忌攻擊你，使他們以忿怒對付你；他們必割去你的鼻子和耳朵，你遺留的人必倒在刀下；他們必奪去你的兒女，並用火焚燒你所遺留的。<br>And I will set My jealousy against you that they may deal with you in wrath; they will remove your nose and your ears, and your residue will fall by the sword; they will take your sons and your daughters, and they will consume your residue with fire.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=27>23:27</a></td><td class=td>這樣，我必使你的淫行，和你從埃及地染來的淫亂止息了，使你不再仰望他們，也不再追念埃及。<br>Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and to your fornication brought from the land of Egypt, so that you will not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=29>23:29</a></td><td class=td>他們必以恨惡對付你，奪取你一切勞碌得來的，撇下你赤身露體；你淫亂的下體，連你的淫行，帶你的淫亂，都被顯露。<br>And they will deal with you in hatred and will take all that you have gained; and they will abandon you, naked and bare, and the nakedness of your fornication will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your fornication.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=30>23:30</a></td><td class=td>人必向你行這些事，因為你隨從外邦人行邪淫，被他們的偶像玷汙了。<br>These things will be done to you because you have gone after the nations as a harlot, because you have defiled yourself with their idols.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=31>23:31</a></td><td class=td>你走了你姐姐所走的路，所以我必將她的杯交在你手中。<br>You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=32>23:32</a></td><td class=td>主耶和華如此說，你必喝你姐姐所喝的杯；那杯又深又廣，盛得甚多，使你被人嗤笑譏刺。<br>Thus says the Lord Jehovah, You will drink your sister's cup, Deep and wide; You will be a laughingstock and a mockery; It contains much.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=33>23:33</a></td><td class=td>你必酩酊大醉，滿有愁苦，喝幹那令人驚駭淒涼的杯，就是你姐姐撒瑪利亞的杯。<br>You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, The cup of horror and desolation, The cup of your sister Samaria.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=34>23:34</a></td><td class=td>你必喝這杯，以致喝盡，杯破又啃杯片；你必撕裂自己的胸；因為這事我曾說過，這是主耶和華說的。<br>And you will drink it and drain it And gnaw at its shards; And you will tear out your breasts; For I have spoken, declares the Lord Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=35>23:35</a></td><td class=td>主耶和華如此說，因你忘記我，將我丟在背後，所以你也要擔當你淫行和淫亂的報應。<br>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because you have forgotten Me and have cast Me behind your back, bear now as well your lewdness and your fornication.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width=50><a name=36>23:36</a></td><td class=td>耶和華又對我說，人子阿，你要審問阿荷拉與阿荷利巴麼？當向她們說明她們所行可憎的事。<br>And Jehovah said to me, Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare their abominations to them.</td></tr>
